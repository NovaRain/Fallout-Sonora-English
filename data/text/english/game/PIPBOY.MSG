{2000}{}{ These records I leave for my descendants as a}  
{2001}{}{ warning. Keep them secret from the other inhabitants}  
{2002}{}{ and pass them from father to son, as my father did to}  
{2003}{}{ me.}  
{2004}{}{}  
{2005}{}{ Our people's history begins in Vault 27. This massive}  
{2006}{}{ underground bunker was built before the Great War,}  
{2007}{}{ and is located near Phoenix, Arizona.}  
{2008}{}{**END-PAR**}  
{2009}{}{ To you, my descendants, such a place might seem}  
{2010}{}{ unwelcoming and strange. You are used to the sunlight}  
{2011}{}{ and the golden sands of Sonora; you cannot}  
{2012}{}{ understand the gloomy rooms of the Vault with its low}  
{2013}{}{ ceilings and cold steel walls. But those very walls and}  
{2014}{}{ technology saved our lives and our ancestors' lives,}  
{2015}{}{ when nuclear bombs fell on the earth.}  
{2016}{}{**END-PAR**}  
{2017}{}{ For a long time, we didn't dare to go to the surface.}  
{2018}{}{ The world above was uninhabitable due to mutants,}  
{2019}{}{ ruins, and high radiation. But the longer the}  
{2020}{}{ scientists and citizens argued about it, the fewer}  
{2021}{}{ resources remained in the Vault for survival. Society}  
{2022}{}{ was fracturing, riots broke out one after another,}  
{2023}{}{ and some residents left for the wasteland on their}  
{2024}{}{ own. A decision had to be made quickly. The only thing}  
{2025}{}{ that could ensure our survival was the Garden of Eden}  
{2026}{}{ Creation Kit. A great pre-war technology capable of}  
{2027}{}{ breathing life into the desert. Scientists agreed that}  
{2028}{}{ using it near the Vault would be a reckless waste of}  
{2029}{}{ this valuable technology. The positive effect would be}  
{2030}{}{ nullified by the environment. And we couldn't explore}  
{2031}{}{ distant lands.}  
{2032}{}{**END-PAR**}  
{2033}{}{ When the situation became desperate, I gathered the}  
{2034}{}{ best people I could trust even a little. We stole the}  
{2035}{}{ G.E.C.K. and left the Vault, leaving most of the}  
{2036}{}{ population to fend for themselves. The journey was}  
{2037}{}{ tough. Many died from radiation, mutants, and}  
{2038}{}{ occasional raiders. Some betrayed us and were}  
{2039}{}{ executed. At the end of the journey, only a few}  
{2040}{}{ families remained. When hope was lost, we stumbled}  
{2041}{}{ upon this unremarkable place. The G.E.C.K. detector}  
{2042}{}{ deemed it suitable for creating a garden city. But}  
{2043}{}{ even with this technology, it took years before we}  
{2044}{}{ managed to establish the Villa.}  
{2045}{}{**END-PAR**}  
{2046}{}{ Now you know the price of our prosperity. And}  
{2047}{}{ although I do not regret what happened, doubts}  
{2048}{}{ remain deep in my soul. Did we do the right thing? How}  
{2049}{}{ many people did we betray? How many did we doom to}  
{2050}{}{ suffering after our departure? No one can answer}  
{2051}{}{ these questions now. So the only right decision is to}  
{2052}{}{ forget the past and live for the future.}  
{2053}{}{**END-PAR**}  
{2054}{}{ Our future is our land and our children. Protect them.}  
{2055}{}{ Preserve our way. Avoid ancient technologies. Drive}  
{2056}{}{ away outsiders before they can cause harm. If one}  
{2057}{}{ generation breaks the covenant, the community will}  
{2058}{}{ fall.}  
{2059}{}{**END-PAR**}

# Diary from Vault 27
# GVAR_HOLODISK_02
#----------------------------------------------
# - SETTLEMENT
{3000}{}{ - October 23, 2077:}
{3001}{}{ Starting this diary on the advice of the}
{3002}{}{ psychologist. My family and I were at home doing our}
{3003}{}{ usual activities when suddenly the siren blared over}
{3004}{}{ Mesa. Catherine thought it was a routine system}
{3005}{}{ check. Still, I insisted we take shelter in the vault.}
{3006}{}{ On the way, the radio reported the first explosions}
{3007}{}{ on the West Coast. Soon after, we saw a flash over}
{3008}{}{ Phoenix. The sound of the explosion reached us later.}
{3009}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3010}{}{ Moving in was hell. There was a jam before the vault,}
{3011}{}{ we had to abandon the car on the road. We were}
{3012}{}{ assigned a room and given one Pip-Boy for the whole}
{3013}{}{ family. They also put Mexicans in our room! Turns out,}
{3014}{}{ there are way more people in the vault than there}
{3015}{}{ should be. We were lucky-some are sleeping in the}
{3016}{}{ corridors. What were the Vault-Tec clerks thinking}
{3017}{}{ when they made the settlement lists?}
{3018}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3019}{}{ - November 12, 2077:}
{3020}{}{ My neighbors and I couldn't get along for a long time.}
{3021}{}{ We divided the room with a screen into two parts.}
{3022}{}{ Catherine demanded that I evict them. But what can I}
{3023}{}{ do in such a situation? The children reconciled us. For}
{3024}{}{ their sake, we agreed to behave decently. After all,}
{3025}{}{ little Susie has the hardest time of all. And the}
{3026}{}{ overseer can't cope with overpopulation. Information}
{3027}{}{ about illegal settlers turned out to be false. It looks}
{3028}{}{ like Vault-Tec is in for some serious lawsuits. But}
{3029}{}{ what should we do now?}
{3030}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3031}{}{ - February 7, 2078:}
{3032}{}{ My Mexican neighbor was killed, suspicions fell on me, of}
{3033}{}{ course. I spent a day in a punishment cell. The killer}
{3034}{}{ turned out to be a former truck driver-typical}
{3035}{}{ criminal, mentally ill. He finally went crazy and claimed}
{3036}{}{ that the vault was overpopulated with illegal Mexicans.}
{3037}{}{ But something else is more important. I used to want}
{3038}{}{ the neighbors to disappear. And now I feel like I've lost}
{3039}{}{ a family member. And by the way, only 15% of the}
{3040}{}{ population is Mexican. Their eviction will not solve the}
{3041}{}{ problem permanently.}
{3042}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3043}{}{ - December 11, 2082:}
{3044}{}{ Water and electricity supplies have been cut. The}
{3045}{}{ education and entertainment sections are closed. Food}
{3046}{}{ rations are given out on schedule, one per person.}
{3047}{}{ More deaths, and there are fights in the corridors.}
{3048}{}{ The medical office is overwhelmed. Constant stress.}
{3049}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3050}{}{ - January 2, 2083:}
{3051}{}{ Another murder, this time a white American. Zachary}
{3052}{}{ Taylor, a former soldier and Anchorage veteran, took}
{3053}{}{ charge of the investigation. He quickly found the}
{3054}{}{ "culprit" and, along with his followers, carried out a}
{3055}{}{ lynching. I had to go along with it to avoid suspicion,}
{3056}{}{ but I stood in the column of dissenters. I need to be}
{3057}{}{ more cautious and take a neutral, waiting position. I}
{3058}{}{ initially sympathized with Taylor, but when he}
{3059}{}{ suggested expelling all Mexicans outside, I got}
{3060}{}{ seriously worried. I wouldn't want to see such a person}
{3061}{}{ as overseer.}
{3062}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3063}{}{ - March 13, 2084:}
{3064}{}{ Hugo and his gang seized the water purification}
{3065}{}{ section and started blackmailing the overseer.}
{3066}{}{ Taylor's men took action. The two factions}
{3067}{}{ slaughtered each other in the cramped spaces. It}
{3068}{}{ ended with the lynching of all the defeated, as well as}
{3069}{}{ their accomplices and the station workers. Well. We fled}
{3070}{}{ to the vault to escape war. But war awaited us here.}
{3071}{}{ Maybe it's in people's blood. Susie cries at night when}
{3072}{}{ she dreams of our home. Can't wait to get to the}
{3073}{}{ surface.}
{3074}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3075}{}{ - December 16, 2084:}
{3076}{}{ This is the end. The overseer cut all the supplies.}
{3077}{}{ Taylor's men killed him in his sleep and forcefully took}
{3078}{}{ his position. Now Zachary Taylor is our new overseer.}
{3079}{}{ And I dread to think what rules this old soldier will}
{3080}{}{ establish here. Twenty people disappeared from the}
{3081}{}{ vault overnight. No one saw anything. No one knows}
{3082}{}{ anything. And under no circumstances should you ask}
{3083}{}{ about it.}
{3084}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3085}{}{ - August 24, 2091:}
{3086}{}{ Thanks to Taylor's dictatorship, order and discipline}
{3087}{}{ have reigned in the vault all this time. It was hard, but}
{3088}{}{ we managed. There are rumors of going to the surface.}
{3089}{}{ This thought is incredibly welcome, especially for Susie.}
{3090}{}{ But the overseer made it clear that it's too early. If}
{3091}{}{ you think about it, much has changed: a new}
{3092}{}{ generation has grown up, and we have grown old and}
{3093}{}{ gotten used to these cold walls. Most are afraid to}
{3094}{}{ leave. And where would we go? My house is probably}
{3095}{}{ burned down or crumbled to dust. And what about}
{3096}{}{ here? We lack food, water, air, and the blue sky}
{3097}{}{ overhead. We need time to gather our thoughts.}
{3098}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3099}{}{ - January 18, 2092:}
{3100}{}{ There are more and more heated debates about}
{3101}{}{ leaving. Reconnaissance results are disappointing.}
{3102}{}{ Some believe that the G.E.C.K. will change the}
{3103}{}{ situation, others think its effect will be muted by the}
{3104}{}{ environment. Society is splitting into factions again,}
{3105}{}{ just like it did before. But the overseer is not the}
{3106}{}{ same - he's old and weak. The strength has faded from}
{3107}{}{ his face. Or maybe it's the dim light illuminating his}
{3108}{}{ tired gaze. Will we really grow old in this crypt? Some}
{3109}{}{ have left the vault. Taylor told them not to return.}
{3110}{}{ And Susie was with them. I am pathetic.}
{3111}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3112}{}{ - March 22, 2092:}
{3113}{}{ Felix Tejada did it. He fought his way to the G.E.C.K.}
{3114}{}{ and led his followers into the wasteland. He had been}
{3115}{}{ preparing for this plan for several years. I also}
{3116}{}{ received an invitation from him, but I declined. After}
{3117}{}{ all, Katherine wouldn't go, and she is the only thing I}
{3118}{}{ have left. And I simply don't want to. The overseer has}
{3119}{}{ sealed the vault door for good. Ironically, he used to}
{3120}{}{ want to expel as many people as possible, but now he}
{3121}{}{ won't let anyone out.}
{3122}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3123}{}{ Now the vault is empty. And quiet.}
{3124}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3125}{}{ Like a crypt.}
{3126}{}{**END-PAR**}
{3127}{}{ That's fine. Let it stay that way.}

{4005}{}{}
{4006}{}{**END-PAR**}
{4007}{}{ - Report #02-04: We reached our destination, but as}
{4008}{}{ the guide warned, the vault door was closed. The door}
{4009}{}{ console does not respond to commands, it seems there}
{4010}{}{ is no electricity in the vault. We'll have to dig. I'm}
{4011}{}{ sending a list of necessary tools to headquarters.}
{4012}{}{ Casualties: one slave twisted his ankle while carrying}
{4013}{}{ equipment, had to shoot him. Plans until the convoy}
{4014}{}{ arrives: fortify the camp, survey the area, start}
{4015}{}{ digging.}
{4016}{}{}
{4017}{}{**END-PAR**}
{4018}{}{ - Report #02-09:}
{4019}{}{ Received shipment requested in report 02-04. Just in}
{4020}{}{ time: we are almost at the steel wall of the vault. The}
{4021}{}{ guide suddenly left the camp. Before leaving, he}
{4022}{}{ warned of the vault's curse, which caused unrest}
{4023}{}{ among the slaves. Had to apply force to shut them up.}
{4024}{}{}
{4025}{}{**END-PAR**}
{4026}{}{ - Report #02-10:}
{4027}{}{ The digging was completed despite the useless slaves.}
{4028}{}{ Nearly all the explosives were used to breach the wall.}
{4029}{}{ The condition of the vault is unsatisfactory, there is}
{4030}{}{ no electricity, the elevator is blocked. Descending to}
{4031}{}{ the lower levels is currently impossible. We are sending}
{4032}{}{ a convoy with valuable finds: medical equipment}
{4033}{}{ (autodoc, tools), electrotechnical parts (spools of}
{4034}{}{ cable, vacuum tubes, terminal parts), archival records}
{4035}{}{ from the computers. This is much less than the}
{4036}{}{ headquarters expected.}
{4037}{}{}
{4038}{}{**END-PAR**}
{4039}{}{ - Report #03-01:}
{4040}{}{ We blew up the elevator and lowered a rope to the}
{4041}{}{ bottom. The slaves heard wierd sounds from the lower}
{4042}{}{ floors and mistook them for ghost voices. This scared}
{4043}{}{ them and caused them to flee. Casualties: one}
{4044}{}{ mercenary killed and two wounded; three slaves}
{4045}{}{ escaped, the rest were killed. For the next convoy, we}
{4046}{}{ request new slaves. Exploration of the lower levels is}
{4047}{}{ on hold. Setting up lighting equipment.}
{4048}{}{}
{4049}{}{**END-PAR**}
{4050}{}{ - Report #03-02:}
{4051}{}{ Looks like that guide was right - the vault really is}
{4052}{}{ cursed! Something on the lower level grabbed the}
{4053}{}{ lighting technician and dragged him into the darkness.}
{4054}{}{ Two mercenaries went after him and did not return.}
{4055}{}{ Gunshots were heard. The expedition members are}
{4056}{}{ terrified. We plan a massive sweep of the levels with}
{4057}{}{ the remaining team.}

{5016}{}{ The second is to collect the sacred nuclear resources}

{5018}{}{ According to our data, there is one of the Tombs of}  
{5019}{}{ Atom in Quartzsite - the Petro-Chico gas station.}  
{5020}{}{ Find it and open it with all due respect. If it is}

{7017}{}{ You must present yourself as the true leader of the}
{7018}{}{ city. For this, any means are suitable, including }
{7019}{}{ threats, lies, and bribery. Declare yourself mayor,}
{7020}{}{ fabricate a legend about your achievements and }
{7021}{}{ deceive the city with rigged elections. }
{7022}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7023}{}{ - Elimination of Dissidents and Conflict Citizens }
{7024}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7025}{}{ You should only keep those inhabitants who support}
{7026}{}{ or fear you. Come up with cunning methods - poisoning,}
{7027}{}{ accidents, execution on false charges. }
{7028}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7029}{}{ - Implementation of Population Supervision and Control}
{7030}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7031}{}{ They must fear you. The best way for this is }
{7032}{}{ intimidation and public executions. You must wield}
{7033}{}{ power - weapons and loyal soldiers. Hire mercenaries,}

{7036}{}{ - Seizing Key Positions in the City }
{7037}{}{**END-PAR**}
{7038}{}{ You must place a loyal dog in charge of the water }

{8000}{}{ Aaron, my Lord!}
{8001}{}{ I hasten to inform you of our situation.}
{8002}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8003}{}{ We've been stationed near San Brahmin three weeks}
{8004}{}{ now. Any longer, and my soldiers will start marrying}
{8005}{}{ these filthy and ugly savages.}
{8006}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8007}{}{ We're running out of provisions, I asked the supply}
{8008}{}{ center to send additional rations (full request}
{8009}{}{ attached to the report).}
{8010}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8011}{}{ During this time, I've tried numerous times to}
{8012}{}{ establish contact with the local chiefs and persuade}
{8013}{}{ them to ally. But the chiefs stand firm, like a stubborn}
{8014}{}{ pack brahmin. Today we had another round of talks,}
{8015}{}{ and I was only mocked.}
{8016}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8017}{}{ We're just wasting time, my lord. These filthy savages}
{8018}{}{ can't be assimilated or made an autonomous part of}
{8019}{}{ the empire. They can only be subdued with a harsh whip}
{8020}{}{ and steel shackles, like in the good old days.}
{8021}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8022}{}{ I beg you, Aaron. Give me more soldiers and weapons,}
{8023}{}{ and I'll capture the old pueblo in no time. I'll disarm}
{8024}{}{ these savages so they cease to be a threat to}
{8025}{}{ ordinary people and caravaneers. I'll drive the}
{8026}{}{ remnants of the dissenters into a reserve like a herd}
{8027}{}{ of mindless cattle.}
{8028}{}{**END-PAR**}
{8029}{}{ Just give the order!}
{8030}{}{**END-PAR**}

# Letter from "Vault-Tec"
# GVAR_HOLODISK_08
#----------------------------------------------
{9000}{}{ Dear Mr. and Mrs. Buren,}
{9001}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9002}{}{ Congratulations on being accepted into the vault}
{9003}{}{ community!}
{9004}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9005}{}{ Enclosed, you will find a complete set of rules and}
{9006}{}{ procedures related to preparing for your move to the}
{9007}{}{ "Vault-Tec" facility, but we want to highlight a few}
{9008}{}{ key points:}
{9009}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9010}{}{ - "Vault-Tec" provides residents with furnished}
{9011}{}{ accommodations, clothing, and bedding. Your personal}
{9012}{}{ belongings must be inspected and approved by an}
{9013}{}{ authorized "Vault-Tec" technician. Only then can they be}
{9014}{}{ delivered to your reserved vault quarters. In case of an}
{9015}{}{ emergency move to the facility, you will not be able to}
{9016}{}{ bring any personal items.}
{9017}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9018}{}{ - All vault residents must participate in an orientation}
{9019}{}{ seminar. If you haven't attended during your application}
{9020}{}{ and review process, please contact your assigned Vault-}
{9021}{}{ Tec representative.}
{9022}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9023}{}{ - In the event of vault activation (both real and drill),}
{9024}{}{ Vault-Tec will sound a siren, audible in the vicinity of the}
{9025}{}{ vault. Residents will also receive a holographic message at}
{9026}{}{ the phone number listed in their records. Upon receiving}
{9027}{}{ such a signal, immediately proceed to the vault and await}
{9028}{}{ entry authorization.}
{9029}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9030}{}{ We eagerly await you becoming our dearest guests!}
{9031}{}{**END-PAR**}
{9032}{}{ Sincerely,}
{9033}{}{ Vault-Tec Public Relations Department}
{9034}{}{ Phoenix, Arizona}
{9035}{}{**END-DISK**}

{10000}{}{ That's it.}
{10001}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10002}{}{ Only five people left on the platform.}
{10003}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10004}{}{ It's become quiet and peaceful here. Not long ago, the}
{10005}{}{ military stormed the platform. Chaos ensued! Workers}
{10006}{}{ fought to keep their jobs, but the government}
{10007}{}{ machine was stronger. It was clear from the start. I}
{10008}{}{ don't understand what they expected in times like}
{10009}{}{ these. A big scandal erupted on the mainland involving}
{10010}{}{ federal television. But they have no chance. Only a}
{10011}{}{ fool would go against a giant corporation.}
{10012}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10013}{}{ Even I wasn't sure that automating the station would}
{10014}{}{ succeed. Can such complex systems be trusted to a}
{10015}{}{ program? What if the systems go rogue? How can a}
{10016}{}{ handful of admin staff in the middle of the sea handle}
{10017}{}{ such a giant in an emergency?}
{10018}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10019}{}{ But it seems robots are even better than humans.}
{10020}{}{ They don't need pay or complain about working}
{10021}{}{ conditions. Local oil will power the station, making it}
{10022}{}{ fully autonomous and likely to last a hundred years}
{10023}{}{ until the robots wear out. Of course, the company}
{10024}{}{ saved a lot by laying off workers. It's just a shame we}
{10025}{}{ have to feed ourselves; even the cooks were sent}
{10026}{}{ ashore.}
{10027}{}{**END-PAR**}
{10028}{}{ Now for the main news - thanks to modernization in}
{10029}{}{ production, my salary was doubled! There's a silver}
{10030}{}{ lining to everything.}
