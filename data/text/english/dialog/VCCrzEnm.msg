{100}{}{You see a peasant.}
{101}{}{You see a resident of the Villa.}
{102}{}{Looks like someone's waiting for you at the exit.}
{103}{}{Let's agree - this conversation never happened.}
{104}{}{Damn it! You... WHAT are you?}
{105}{}{Good to see you.}

{200}{}{How's the search going?}
{201}{}{Great. See you.}
{202}{}{Well... To be honest, I'm not thrilled about the Council's decision either. But this tale needs to be a lesson for everyone. It's for the best.}
{203}{}{I really hope so.}
{204}{}{Take your excuses and shove 'em!}

{210}{}{(on the way out, you unexpectedly run into an old acquaintance who seems to have been lying in wait for you) Well, well. One traitor too many, and now you're next! What the hell are you up to? Trying to wreck our way of life for a coward who couldn't cut it?}
{211}{}{The community's wrong on this. Killing our own is the path to our own downfall.}

{212}{}{Maybe... I don't know anymore! We all changed after the raid. Before that, we lived in peace; no one was throwing stones at each other. Only in the old days, when the Villa was first being built...}
{213}{}{[More]}
{214}{}{Our ancestors used materials from here to build their homes. They say life was tough back then - neighbors would steal from neighbors. But we survived that nightmare and became a tight-knit family. Now, everything's different since the raid.}
{215}{}{Then you should understand, this isn't the way. Let Chris go.}
{216}{}{I can't! He... he needs to be made an example... that's what the community decided...}
{217}{}{You're scared. You're just scared of change coming to Villa.}
{218}{}{Yes! Chris... forgive me.}
{219}{}{Well, looks like that's sorted.}
{220}{}{Then do what you must. I won't stop you.}
{1220}{}{Then do what you must. I won't stop you.}
{221}{}{I don't care what the community decided. Chris goes free.}
{222}{}{The community won't forgive you for this! (spits at your feet and walks away)}
{223}{}{Go back to the herd, you fool...}
{224}{}{Just let Chris go.}
{225}{}{I lead the community now. And my decision is to let Chris go.}
{226}{}{Okay. That's your call, I'll let the others know. Sorry, Chris.}

{230}{}{You got it wrong - I'm taking him to be punished.}
{231}{}{Really? Then why does he have a backpack full of provisions?}
{232}{}{Those are my things. I just made him carry it as part of his punishment.}
{233}{}{Hmm... Yeah, he should be made an example. Nothing personal, Chris. This is what the community decided. Let's go to the plaza. Time for your real punishment.}
{234}{}{[Return to plaza]}

{240}{}{Think what you want. I know what I'm doing.}
{241}{}{Hmph. People have been talking about you. Seems like they weren't wrong.}
{242}{}{Hmph. People have been talking about you. But no one expected *this*!}
{243}{}{Damn it! I don't want to be an outcast in my own home. Fine, take him to the execution, I won't interfere.}
{244}{}{I don't care what the community thinks. Chris goes free.}
