{100}{}{You see a Phoenix resident.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary Phoenix resident. He looks tense, clearly waiting for someone.}
{102}{}{Move along.}

{200}{}{Where you headed, cultist? Trying to run out of the city? Smart move. We'll help you along.}
{201}{}{Really? That's...so kind of you.}
{202}{}{You've got the wrong person.}
{203}{}{Nah, we know you're one of those fire worshippers. And guess what? We're done putting up with your 'nuclear magic'. Get lost, scum.}
{204}{}{No, no, I'm not part of the cult anymore!}
{205}{}{Shut it! After that cathedral blew up, half the city got wiped out. We're not stopping till every last cultist is gone, got it?}
{206}{}{Yeah, I get it.}
{207}{}{Good. Now get out. Cause any trouble, and you're dead.}
{208}{}{Alright...}
{209}{}{No, I don't get it. Run it by me again, dumbass.}
{210}{}{You want me to spell it out, scum...?}
{211}{}{Wait, what're you doing... stop...}
{212}{}{One at a time, guys.}
{213}{}{Hold on, we're on the same side. I'm the one who set off the explosion.}
{214}{}{Wha... You think I'm an idiot? That's gotta be the dumbest thing I've heard.}
{215}{}{It's the truth. The cultists funded slavers who took my family. That explosion was payback.}
{216}{}{Uhh... Even if that's true, you still wrecked Phoenix. You think that makes us feel better? Get out, and if you come back, you're dead. Clear?}
{217}{}{No problem. You won't see me again.}
{218}{}{Don't threaten me. You'll end up in a ditch.}
{219}{}{Believe what you want.}
{220}{}{Looks like this idiot doesn't understand. Guess we'll have to use our fists...}
{1220}{}{Looks like this bitch needs a little more convincing. Guess we'll do it the hard way...}
{221}{}{Just take it easy, alright...?}
{222}{}{This is your last mistake.}
{223}{}{You're threatening me? Everyone who does ends up dead real fast.}

{230}{}{Hey, you. What's with your burned skin?}
{231}{}{Huh? What's it to you?}
{232}{}{Who did this to you? I heard they did experiments under the cathedral to create elite fighters. You were seen there.}
{233}{}{It's a mistake. I'm just a radiation victim. I was looking for a cure in the cathedral.}
{1233}{}{It's a mistake. I'm just a radiation victim. I was looking for a cure in the cathedral.}
{234}{}{Maybe... We're hunting cult remnants to drive them out. Keep out of out way.}
{235}{}{Of course, no problem here.}
{236}{}{Hmm... (looks from head to toe with open disgust) You can go.}
{237}{}{...}
{238}{}{My face makes me stand out a bit, huh? What's your problem with fire worshippers?}
{239}{}{We're eradicating all cultists. After the cathedral explosion, they have no place here. Neither do you.}
{240}{}{Why the hostility? Didn't the fire worshippers preach patience and love?}
{241}{}{In words, maybe. But they were building a nuclear bomb in their secret dungeon. Scum like them can't be trusted... Anyway, you're not welcome here. Get out, mutant trash.}
{242}{}{I won't argue. Good luck, guys.}
{243}{}{Mutant trash... You know, I oughtta tear out your eyes and suck your brains out of your fuckin' skull.}
{244}{}{This freak doesn't understand human language. Guys...}
{245}{}{Oh, uh, no need for violence...}
{246}{}{Okay, your funeral boys...}
{247}{}{Exactly. I'm a victim, not a cultist.}
{248}{}{I don't believe you. Guys, don't let him escape...}
{1248}{}{I don't believe you. Guys, don't let her escape...}
{249}{}{Not in the face...}
{250}{}{Maybe... Okay, go. But if we find out you're a fire worshipper, you'll burn at the stake with the others.}

{260}{}{Hold up there. I'm not lookin' for a fight, but I have to say this. We know you're a former fire worshipper. People like that aren't welcome here. Leave and don't come back. If you do, all your weapons and armor won't save you.}
{261}{}{I understand. You won't see me again. Goodbye.}
{262}{}{I'm not going anywhere. Why don't you make good your threat?}
{263}{}{(look at each other nervously) We don't want a fight. Uh... not yet. But if uh, necessary, we'll make sure you're gone by tomorrow.}
{264}{}{Ohh... sorry, but too late asshole. Whether you want it or not, the fight happens now.}
{265}{}{You're confusing me with someone else.}
{266}{}{Really? I don't think so. Get out of town. We don't want a fight, but if, uh, necessary, we'll start one.}
{267}{}{A fight? Let's go, right now.}
{268}{}{Well, I'll think about it. Bye.}
