{100}{}{You see Abel.}
{101}{}{You see a representative of the Church of the Holy Fire.}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{Are you here on business? Then you need to go to Master Hard. You'll find him in the workshop.}
{201}{}{Thanks.}
{202}{}{I'd like to talk to you.}
{203}{}{Too nice to be true. Name's Abel. I'm one of the Followers of Fire, if that rings a bell. Now stop wasting my time.}
{204}{}{What do you do?}
{205}{}{I see you're persistent. The church needs the services of Tinsmiths, just like any modern community. I oversee the fulfillment of the church's orders.}
{206}{}{Tinsmiths are that good?}
{207}{}{They're the best at what they do. You might have seen their work: air guns, computing devices, even prosthetics and simple implants. Thankfully, they're smart enough not to deal with just anyone. They don't share knowledge and technology lightly. Our church is fortunate to have their cooperation.}
{208}{}{Got it. I'll check it out. Goodbye.}
{209}{}{Cooperation in striving for power in this region. Take care.}

# Re-dialogue
{210}{}{You again?}
{211}{}{Forget it.}
{212}{}{How can I help, brother?}
{1212}{}{How can I help, sister?}
{213}{}{Thanks, I'll figure it out later.}
{214}{}{That's enough info for today.}
{215}{}{I'm wasting my time talking to you.}
{216}{}{No problem, I'm heading out.}

{220}{}{Tell me about your church.}
{221}{}{That's a long story. Best to visit our Phoenix cathedral and see for yourself.}
{222}{}{Okay.}

{230}{}{Actually, I'm a Follower of Fire too.}
{231}{}{Really? That changes things. Welcome to Two-Sun, brother. Together we'll glorify the Holy Fire.}
{1231}{}{Really? That changes things. Welcome to Two-Sun, sister. Together we'll glorify the Holy Fire.}
{232}{}{I see you're more open now. Can I ask a couple of questions?}
{233}{}{I see.}
{234}{}{Thanks for the answers. Time to get to work.}

{240}{}{What does the church in Two-Sun actually do?}
{241}{}{As I mentioned, the church needs technology and knowledge. One of our main beliefs is that the Holy Fire burned down the old civilization to build a new one. Tinsmiths are the builders of this new world. Their skills and tech are essential for survival and growth. Sadly, many in the wasteland don't get the idea of Progress; they fear change.}
{242}{}{What orders are Tinsmiths currently fulfilling?}
{243}{}{The top priority is energy batteries. Without them, serious equipment is just scrap. They also make weapons and fix old electronics.}
{244}{}{How did the Tinsmiths learn about these technologies?}
{245}{}{Their skills have been passed down through generations, piecing together knowledge from across the wasteland - our church, trades with passing caravans, and whatever scraps of wisdom they could find.}
{246}{}{You don't preach in this city?}
{247}{}{The Church aims to expand, but in Two-Sun, one ambassador is enough. The Tinsmiths don't share our faith exactly, but their support is enough for our shared success.}
{248}{}{Something tells me there are orders you'd rather keep quiet about.}
{249}{}{Now I see why the church accepted you. Yes, there are special technologies that regular folks shouldn't know about. These could upset the balance of power or spark unrest.}
{250}{}{Throughout history, peaceful technologies have often been turned into weapons, causing more harm than good.}
{251}{}{If anyone can drive progress in this region, while heeding the lessons of the past, it's us, the servants of the Holy Fire. We've lived by this belief and won't give it up. Trust me, the church is doing everything to turn Sonora into a paradise.}
{252}{}{Peaceful technologies? Please. If anyone knows how to *really* drive progress in this region, it's us, the servants of the Holy Fire. We've lived by this belief and won't give it up. Trust me, the church knows what it's doing to turn Sonora into a paradise.}

{260}{}{The Tinsmiths have enslaved several of my friends. Is there any way to free them?}
{261}{}{But why? I doubt your friends are that valuable outside of slavery. Serving Progress is a great honor and benefit to all humanity. Most of the slaves have already been sent to the Forbidden Zone. You'll have to go there and save your friends yourself.}
{262}{}{While I think about that, let's talk about something else.}
{263}{}{I think I'll have to do that then. Bye.}

# GG enemy cult
{300}{}{You again? Get out of this city before I call the guards.}
{301}{}{Wait, why so much hostility?}
{302}{}{Don't waste your breath, atomic ignoramus! The Followers of Fire have a good network of informants. I've already been told about your expulsion. Leave!}
{303}{}{Take it easy...}

{310}{}{Stop. Who... Who sent you?}
{311}{}{Nobody. Why are you so nervous?}
{312}{}{I have my reasons. And you shouldn't show your face in this city at all. It's highly suspicious that an enemy of the Followers of Fire is visiting the Tinsmiths. Looks like you're playing your game right under our noses.}
{313}{}{So the Church of the Holy Fire isn't held in such high esteem here anymore?}
{314}{}{The Church was the main engine of progress in Southern Arizona. Now that the main temple's been destroyed, it'll take a lot of effort to restore its former greatness and trust. But the Tinsmiths served us for almost ten years. They won't betray their patrons over a single setback.}
{315}{}{Then why are you so worked up? Looks like the Tinsmiths are less submissive now, huh?}
{316}{}{We considered them work machines. Now that they've tasted freedom and... superiority, a show of force might be needed to put them back in their place. Now stop sneering, you despicable atom. Get out of my sight.}
{317}{}{You know, I'm not the one who needs to get out of Two-Sun. You are.}
{318}{}{Take care, cultist...}
{319}{}{Come on, no need to be aggressive...}
{320}{}{Leave me alone, demon of atomic fission!}
{321}{}{Whatever...}
