{100}{}{You see Murphy.}
{101}{}{You see one of the Red Cardinals.}
{102}{}{I could use your armor.}
{103}{}{Are you ratting? Come here, we need to talk.}
{104}{}{Stay away from me, rat.}
{1104}{}{Stay away from me, rat.}
{105}{}{Good to see you.}
{106}{}{Murphy's waiting for you in the arena.}

{200}{}{Hey, rat. Watch it. I don't want to get dirty dealing with you.}
{1200}{}{Hey, whore. Go wash yourself. I can't stand it when a slut stinks.}
{2200}{}{Hey, mutie. Stay away from me. I don't want to catch that filth from you.}
{201}{}{Come on, Murphy. Ease back on the hostility a bit, huh?}
{202}{}{Don't count on it. Unlike Orris, I'm not that gullible.}
{203}{}{Alright. Whatever. Later, Murphy.}
{204}{}{Likewise. You should wash up, slimeball.}
{205}{}{Orris needs you for now. But give me a chance - and you'll be bleeding out at my feet.}
{1205}{}{Orris needs you for now. But give me a chance - and you'll be bleeding out at my feet.}
{206}{}{Hmph. Ditto, Murphy.}
{207}{}{I'll just keep my distance then.}
{208}{}{Yeah. Know your place.}
{209}{}{Whatever, Murphy.}

{210}{}{What do you want?}
{1210}{}{What do you want, bitch?}
{2210}{}{What do you want, mutie?}
{211}{}{Whoa, easy. I'm leaving.}
{212}{}{Hey. What do you need?}
{213}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{214}{}{Hey. What's up? Everything good?}
{215}{}{Everything's just fine. Bye.}
{216}{}{Good to see you.}
{217}{}{Bye.}

{220}{}{I hear there's a spy in the Red Cardinals. Got any idea who?}
{221}{}{That's crazy. There's no filthy fuckin' rat here. We can't stand those fire worshippers. We can't even get close to their cathedral. They see us as criminals.}
{222}{}{Yeah, maybe not then.}
{223}{}{I'll prove there's a spy here.}
{224}{}{I know who you are, Murphy. I know you're really a Follower and work for the Church. Want to talk about it?}
{225}{}{Damn it, what are you talking about? A Follower? I got nothin' to do with those cultists. Got it?}
{226}{}{Of course, of course. But if you want to discuss this, meet me at the arena tonight. We'll talk quietly.}
{227}{}{Come to think of it, there's more than one Murphy in this city. Never mind.}

{230}{}{I told you everything. If you're gonna help, make your move.}
{231}{}{Okay.}
{232}{}{So what the hell is this? Were you sent from the Cathedral?}
{233}{}{I know you're an agent of the Followers. Must've been tough to get in with Orris?}
{234}{}{Aaron needs agents everywhere. This is my mission. It's risky even meeting you. Who are you?}
{235}{}{You could say I'm playing my own game.}
{236}{}{Not the most believable answer. Still, it means we might come to an agreement. I want Orris' spot and to reform the gang for the church. If these guys can only punch faces, they might as well punch the right ones.}
{237}{}{Ambitious plans.}
{238}{}{Are you gonna help me then? The Church of the Holy Fire will remember your deeds. I can't take down Orris alone without fallout.}
{239}{}{You're a traitor. I don't trust traitors.}
{240}{}{I was a Follower from the start. Just stay out of my way.}
{241}{}{Well, we'll see.}
{242}{}{I agree that the Red Cardinals and Orris need to be dealt with. How could I help?}
{243}{}{Orris has to be taken out. But it won't be easy to do it without a fuss. It has to be quiet. Poison? An overdose? Maybe a silenced weapon? I'm not sure.}
{244}{}{I'll think about it.}
{245}{}{Orris is dead, I know. Thanks to you, the city will be safer, and the Holy Fire's work will shine over the ruins again.}
{246}{}{It had to be done.}
{247}{}{I'll let the Cathedral know about your help to avoid future misunderstandings. Goodbye, my friend.}
{1247}{}{I'll let the Cathedral know about your help to avoid future misunderstandings. Goodbye, sister.}
{248}{}{Goodbye, Murphy.}
{249}{}{Even though the cathedral's in ruins, thanks to you, hope remains. Maybe all is not lost yet.}

{250}{}{What are you up to, Murphy?}
{251}{}{All the things Orris' right hand should do. He trusts me with the tough problems.}
{252}{}{So you're Orris' right hand man? Nice gig.}
{253}{}{How'd you join the gang?}
{254}{}{No place for softies here. I dealt with small 'problems' for Orris until he saw my potential.}
{255}{}{Like to live dangerously, huh? Watch yourself.}
{256}{}{Are the fire worshippers trying to push you out?}
{257}{}{Damn cultists. Can't stand them. They preach what's right and wrong. Why should we care? There's only one law here - the strongest rules. We've proven it. Only we have the right to control this territory.}
{258}{}{I get it.}
{259}{}{I'm on your side, Murphy. But how can I get to Orris?}

{260}{}{Hey, do you know who sabotaged the power plant?}
{261}{}{Maybe. Why you askin'?}
{262}{}{I'm looking in to it for Theodore.}
{263}{}{Don't like those ghouls much, so why would I turn over their enemies?}
{264}{}{Then forget it. I'll keep asking around.}
{265}{}{Go ahead, spill it. You can trust me.}
{266}{}{No way. Get lost.}
{267}{}{Too bad you don't trust me.}
{268}{}{Even if you're involved, why would I turn you in? You've nothing to be worried about.}
{269}{}{Worried? Me? Ha! Not even close. I'm in on it. We pulled it off. The Cathedral wanted to sabotage things to push the ghouls into cooperation - they can't fix anything on their own. Made it easy when one of the top ghouls, Ralph, opened the underground door for us. He's trying to cozy up to the fire worshippers, so he gave us a hand.}
{270}{}{Damn, quite the story! Now I know who's boss here. Bye, Murphy.}
{271}{}{Why hide anything? You're a cool guy. Just tell me.}
{272}{}{Thought the Cardinals were tough... you worried?}
