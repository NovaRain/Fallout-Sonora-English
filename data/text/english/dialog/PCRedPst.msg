{100}{}{You see a Red Cardinal.}
{101}{}{You see a gangster with a stylish haircut and a gang logo on his back.}

{200}{}{Hey, what are you doing here? Don't you know whose turf this is?}
{201}{}{I don't know. Whose?}
{202}{}{Never heard of the Red Cardinals? Where've you been hiding?}
{1202}{}{Never heard of the Red Cardinals? Where've you been hiding?}
{203}{}{Far away.}
{204}{}{Yeah, well, beat it if you value your life. Consider this a warning.}
{205}{}{Alright.}
{206}{}{Whatever. I'm going in.}
{207}{}{Your call, but Orris and the others won't be happy about it. You looking for Orris? He's here, but you better have a damn good reason.}
{208}{}{I'll handle it.}
{209}{}{Turf? No one owns the streets.}
{210}{}{What, are you a retard? Get lost.}
{211}{}{You'd better scram.}
{1211}{}{Hey baby... we're not in the mood for hookers right now. Try later. For now, scram.}
{212}{}{Alright, I'm leaving.}
{213}{}{Hey. How's it going?}

{214}{}{Did you know someone leaked your dealings to the fire worshippers?}
{215}{}{What? There's a cultist spy among us? That can't be. I can't even imagine who it could be.}
{216}{}{If it's you, you're dead meat.}
{217}{}{Don't worry, I'll find out who it is.}
{218}{}{Jeez! What a freak! You'd better scram.}
{1218}{}{Jeez! What a hideous hag! You'd better get outta here.}


#Quest for letters
{220}{}{One of you guys jacked a courier and took his letters.}
{221}{}{So?}
{222}{}{Do you know who?}
{223}{}{Yeah.}
{224}{}{Who?}
{225}{}{It was me.}
{226}{}{Hmph. Well that clears that up. Hand over the letters.}
{227}{}{Haha, you threatening me? ME? Give me one good reason to listen. Something as sweet as caps might do.}
{228}{}{All this over caps, huh?}
{229}{}{What's your price for the letters?}
{230}{}{Caps talk, baby. You know what I mean?}
{231}{}{So this is all about the caps, huh?}
{232}{}{Think I do this for fun? Everyone needs caps. No legit work for folks like me in this town. If the "right" places won't hire me, I'll make my own way.}
{233}{}{Okay. I'll pay 30 caps.}
{234}{}{}
{235}{}{About the Sonora Express letters. Still got 'em?}
{236}{}{They're not moving until I get what's coming to me.}
{237}{}{You need caps, right?}
{238}{}{Yeah, but I need more time to scrape up the caps.}
{239}{}{Looks like you need the caps more than I do.}
{240}{}{I'll get the caps. Just give me some time.}
{241}{}{You know, this is pointless. I'll just kill you and take the letters.}
{242}{}{Fine. You got caps, I got letters. Take 'em.}
{243}{}{Yeah, uh, bye.}
{244}{}{Forget the talk. I'll just kill you and take the letters.}
{245}{}{I'm done with this crap. Bye.}
{246}{}{Those letters are of interest to my church. I suggest you hand them over, lest you incur the wrath of the Holy Fire.}
{247}{}{Argh. Should've started with that. I don't want any heat from your cult. Here, take the damn letters.}
{248}{}{May the Holy Fire have mercy on you, child of Radiation and Desolation.}
{249}{}{Don Diego has an... interest in those letter. It'd be better if you handed them over.}
{250}{}{(overacting) Ah, my apologies, senor. Should've started with that. Who knew someone so high-up would visit our dump. (hands over letters) Give my regards to your boss. Adio-os.}
{1250}{}{(overacting) Oh, I'm sorry, senorita. Should've started with that. Who knew such a famous person would visit our hole. (hands over letters) Send my regards to your boss. Adio-os.}
{251}{}{Know your place, Cardinal. There are stronger forces here than your gang.}
{252}{}{Orris warned me about your stubbornness. Wanna get booted from the gang? I can arrange it.}
{253}{}{Damn, you're too cutthroat, even for us. Here, take the letters. They bore me anyway.}
{1253}{}{Damn, you're too cutthroat, even for us. Here, take the letters. They bore me anyway.}
{254}{}{Yeah.}
{255}{}{I also make "my own way." Want to know how? Beatin' the crap out of people in the ring.}
{256}{}{Yeah, you're one of those tough bastards who survived the ring. I respect that. Here, take the letters. Maybe show me some moves sometime?}
{257}{}{I'll think about it. Business to handle with these letters right now.}
