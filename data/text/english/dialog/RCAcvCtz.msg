{100}{}{You see a settler.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary citizen of Aqueduct.}

{110}{}{I need some rest.}  
{111}{}{We should check the nets early tomorrow.}  
{112}{}{Hrrr...}  
{113}{}{It's too late to talk now.}  
{114}{}{What's going on?}  
{115}{}{Why are you waking people up at this hour?}  
{116}{}{Wake me up like this again, and you'll regret it...}  
{117}{}{}
{118}{}{}
{119}{}{}

{120}{}{Everyone here knows about you. Time to go.}  
{121}{}{You don't belong here.}  
{122}{}{We know what kind of person you are. There's no place for that here.}  
{123}{}{Get out of here.}  
{124}{}{Leave, or the rangers will deal with you.}  
{125}{}{Bother the locals, and Garth'll make sure you regret it.}  
{126}{}{}
{127}{}{}
{128}{}{}
{129}{}{}

{130}{}{Welcome to Aqueduct.}  
{131}{}{Hope you stick around a while.}  
{132}{}{Hey.}  
{133}{}{Good to see you.}  
{134}{}{Looking for a place to stay?}  
{135}{}{I've got some room if you need it.}  
{136}{}{Did the Rangers send you?}  
{137}{}{People like you are needed here.}  
{138}{}{Could use some help cleaning the nets.}  
{139}{}{We could use someone like you here.}  

{140}{}{Sorry, new faces make people nervous.}  
{141}{}{What do you want?}  
{142}{}{I don't know anything, and I've got nothing for you. Understand?}  
{143}{}{Leave me alone.}  
{144}{}{It's been a rough day. We'll talk later.}  
{145}{}{Looks like I'll be sorting nets all day again.}  
{146}{}{That smell? It's just fish and water. We're used to it.}  
{147}{}{They say there's a monster deep in the Colorado.}  
{148}{}{Careful swimming too far - the Arizona Monster's out there.}  
{149}{}{Nothing in the nets today... again.}
