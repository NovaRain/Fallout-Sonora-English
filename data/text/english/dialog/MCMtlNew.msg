{100}{}{You see a transplant from Phoenix.}
{101}{}{You see a man in dusty clothes, his hands covered in dirt.}
{102}{}{Hello.}

{200}{}{What a surprise. We knew travelers sometimes pass through, but we didn't expect a new face so soon.}
{201}{}{Are you new here?}
{202}{}{Yes, we just moved in. If you're looking for a place to stay, sorry - we're full up.}
{203}{}{No, I just want to talk.}
{204}{}{Sleep at this motel? I'd rather spend the night under the open sky.}
{205}{}{Yes, we just moved in. If you're looking for a place to stay, we're full up. But I don't mind exchanging a few words with a rare traveler.}

{210}{}{No vacancies, but I don't mind exchanging a few words with a rare traveler.}
{211}{}{Where did you come from?}
{212}{}{We're transplants from Phoenix, here to start a new community. Aaron himself gave us the deed to this land.}
{213}{}{What did you do to earn that?}
{214}{}{We worked for the glory of His ideas. Besides, Aaron wants to colonize the surrounding area under his banner.}
{215}{}{How can you prove it?}
{216}{}{We have a bill of sale for our work in honor of Aaron's ideas. What makes you doubt us?}
{217}{}{Where did he get the right to this motel?}
{218}{}{Only Aaron controls the lands around Phoenix. Challenge that if you dare.}
{219}{}{That's not true.}
{220}{}{How dare you desecrate the name of a holy man? Keep your filthy tongue shut before I lose my temper. Away!}
{221}{}{Okay, okay...}
{222}{}{Hey, take it easy...}
{223}{}{He's doing a great job.}
{224}{}{Praise be the name of Aaron! The man who brings life to the desert.}
{225}{}{Aaron has been killed. Did you know that?}
{226}{}{Aaron and his cathedral are destroyed. Did you know that?}
{227}{}{How dare you speak such lies? Aaron is alive, and his cathedral stands. Shut your vile mouth before I lose my temper.}
{228}{}{They always get offended by the truth.}
{229}{}{Hey, take it easy...}

{230}{}{Did you know mutants used to live here?}
{231}{}{What happened, happened. We need to start anew, not dwell on the past.}
{232}{}{And you're ready to live here, knowing the horrors that happened within these walls?}
{233}{}{Those mutants, though cannibals and sadists, maintained the motel. That's why we stopped here. It's the only livable place around.}
{234}{}{Did the mutants try?}
{235}{}{They repaired the roof and fence, fertilized the beds, installed water tanks - it's a great place to start over.}
{236}{}{So, you came with everything ready.}
{237}{}{I think it's time for you to go.}
{238}{}{Yes, I gotta go. Bye.}
{239}{}{That was rude. Now I definitely don't want to stay.}
{240}{}{Well, at least this damn place will do some good.}
{241}{}{Everything will be different now. Aaron gave a second chance to us and to the motel. We'll turn this desert into a promised land.}
{242}{}{Amen.}
{243}{}{Good luck.}
