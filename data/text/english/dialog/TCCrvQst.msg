{100}{}{You see a peasant.}
{101}{}{You see a peasant of quite ordinary appearance. It's strange to see him in this crowd.}
{102}{}{Thanks for your help. We won't forget this and will spread word of your deed.}

{200}{}{Hey, you're not from around here, are you? It's pretty obvious. Here's some free advice -- don't mess with these hucksters. They don't care about strangers.}
{201}{}{And you...}
{202}{}{I'm another victim of their bullcrap. The Tinsmiths refuse to sell any fusion cells for our settlement's generator. And you know why? They said we're *unworthy* of old tech!}
{203}{}{Let's hear more about this little problem of yours.}
{204}{}{Not my problem. Goodbye.}

{210}{}{What do you want to know?}
{211}{}{Nothing else. Bye.}
{212}{}{I have to go.}
{213}{}{Tell me more.}

{220}{}{Tell me about your town.}
{221}{}{Just a small rural village. Recently, our generator ran out -- it's the only source of electricity in the entire valley. We turned to the Tinsmiths for help, but they consider us unworthy - too insignificant I guess.}
{222}{}{Is the generator that important to you?}
{223}{}{Our entire community relies on it! Water pump, lighting, radio communications -- without it, our valley turns back into a desert, uninhabitable.}

{230}{}{Isn't there anywhere else to get fusion cells?}
{231}{}{Tinsmiths are the only ones making them nowadays. And pre-war cells are nearly impossible to find. The region has long been scavenged by these techno-fanatics.}
{232}{}{Have you tried looking in Phoenix?}
{233}{}{Are you kidding? We're peasants, traveling that kind of distance is a huge challenge. Plus, the Big City buys from the Tinsmiths too, at much higher prices.}

{240}{}{Why don't the Tinsmiths want to trade with you?}
{241}{}{They see us as unworthy of their technology. They think we'll waste their precious resources. But that's nonsense -- we need the cells to survive, what could be more important?!}

{250}{}{What are you going to do now?}
{251}{}{We urgently need fusion cells... Listen, you're a peasant like us, right? I can tell. No matter the clothing and armor, your eyes and hands give you away. We have to stick together, amigo. Help us, and we'll help you.}
{1251}{}{We urgently need fusion cells... Listen, you're also a peasant like us, right? I can tell. No matter the clothing and armor, your eyes and hands give you away. We have to stick together, amiga. Help us, and we'll help you.}
{252}{}{How can you help me?}
{253}{}{I have many contacts among the caravans. I can arrange an escort for you and boost your reputation. Plus, I have pre-war money. It's not used anymore, but you might find a use for it.}
{254}{}{I'll think about it.}
{255}{}{Who can I talk to about these fusion cells?}
{256}{}{They're stored in that big hangar, and the quartermaster's in charge. But I doubt he'll change his mind.}
{257}{}{We'll see about that.}
{258}{}{Are you suggesting we rob the Tinsmiths?}
{259}{}{Just like they've robbed many others. But you'll save a whole settlement and make friends with honest folk. So, what do you say, amigo?}
{1259}{}{Just like they've robbed many others. But you'll save a whole settlement and make friends with honest folk. So, what do you say, amiga?}


{260}{}{I didn't think anyone else was still here!}
{261}{}{What are you doing here?}
{262}{}{I need fusion cells for the generator. They're in the hangar's warehouse, but I can't get there unnoticed. You seem to have just come from there, and the robots didn't bother you. Can you get one?}
{263}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{264}{}{Deal with your own problems. I've gotta deal with mine.}
{265}{}{I'm outta here.}
{266}{}{Did you get one?}

{300}{}{Here's a fusion cell for the generator.}
{301}{}{Incredible! How did you get it? Never mind, I don't want to know. I need to get out of here while the gettin's good. Thank you, amigo, without you our community would have collapsed.}
{302}{}{Hey, aren't you forgetting something?}
{303}{}{I'm sorry, I... I lied -- I don't have any caravan contacts. But I'll spread word of your heroics. If you want, let's head to Casa Grande together, it's safer. Decide now, I won't wait.}
{304}{}{Let's go.}
{305}{}{No, I'm heading my own way. Goodbye.}
{306}{}{So, you with us? The path to Casa Grande is tough, it's safer to travel together.}
