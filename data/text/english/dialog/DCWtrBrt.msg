{100}{}{You see a water merchant.}
{101}{}{You see an unusually clean man. With a job like his, he doesn't have to get dirty.}
{102}{}{Are you from the Tinsmiths? Then don't scare people with this tin can.}
{103}{}{Highwaymen have no place in this city. Get out before I shoot you.}
{104}{}{This is the price for your greed, bitch.}
{105}{}{Remember your words? This is your payback for greed.}
{106}{}{From now on, the water merchant's selection of goods for you has been expanded.}
{107}{}{I can't talk to two people at the same time.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{(squints at you, wiping his hands on a grimy towel) Don't think I've seen ya' before. New in town?}
{201}{}{Yeah, that's right. What's this place all about?}
{202}{}{Nope, born and raised here. Duh...}
{1202}{}{Nope, born and raised here. Duh...}
{203}{}{Got it. But listen, folks around here don't take kindly to jokers. Life ain't exactly a laugh fest these days.}
{204}{}{Oh, my bad. That was a dumb question. So, what's this place?}
{205}{}{Can see that in your eyes. Chill out, pal. Anyway, where am I exactly?}
{1205}{}{Can see that in your eyes. Chill out, pal. Anyway, where am I exactly?}
{206}{}{This is the water pump. We pull water from underground and sell it to those who need it. This here's the bottling point. Need any water?}
{207}{}{Nah, I'm looking for something else.}
{208}{}{I'm too busy for chit-chat. Don't distract me from my work.}
{209}{}{Jeez, not the friendliest welcome...}
{210}{}{Yes, I need water, and fast.}
{211}{}{Of course. Everyone needs water. But if ya' wanna drink, ya' gotta pay. Nothin's free here.}
{212}{}{Got it. I'll come by when I need to restock. Later.}
{213}{}{How about giving some water to a weary ranger? You'd be doing a good deed.}
{214}{}{(makes a face) Ranger, huh? Can't recall any favors from the rangers. But the caravanners have been buzzin' about you.}
{215}{}{[More]}
{216}{}{Fine. Here's some water for you. But don't ask again. We're running a business, not a charity.}
{217}{}{Thanks, appreciate it.}
{218}{}{Water! Water! I'm dying of thirst...}
{219}{}{And you expect me to buy that act? What a pitiful attempt.}
{220}{}{I won't forget this. One day, you'll pay dearly for your heartless greed.}
{221}{}{Get out of here.}
{222}{}{[Done]}
{223}{}{Yeah, that wasn't my best. Later.}
{224}{}{You'd deny a ranger a drink of life-saving water? I'm not asking for much.}
{225}{}{Water! Water! I'm dying of thirst...}
{226}{}{My god, how many miles did you trek under this blazing sun? Fine, take some water. Just don't drop dead on my floor.}
{227}{}{Thanks a lot...}
{1227}{}{Thanks a lot...}

{230}{}{Hey, hold up a minute. Let me see your neck. Come on, show it.}
{231}{}{What's the deal with this?}
{232}{}{Sorry to be pushy, but after the fall of the Tinsmiths, a lot of slaves escaped from Two-Sun. Can't trust 'em. Just making sure I'm talking to a free person.}
{233}{}{You've got some nerve, you know that?}
{234}{}{I don't need any trouble.}
{235}{}{No collar marks. Good... for both of us.}
{236}{}{Right. Under different circumstances, this could've gone south for you.}
{237}{}{No problem. I get it. All's fine.}
{238}{}{I'm not here to make friends with you.}
{239}{}{Let's just go our separate ways, okay? Consider me gone.}
{240}{}{Well, well, if it isn't a runaway slave. So, what should I do with you?}
{241}{}{Nothing, I suppose. Shall I just leave?}
{242}{}{Yeah. Beat it. Leave town and don't come back.}
{243}{}{[Done]}
{244}{}{Who do you think you are? Mind your own business.}
{245}{}{Oh, look at that. Seems we got ourselves an escapee. Trying to mess up my reputation, are you?}
{246}{}{Back again? Just a heads-up - water prices have gone up.}
{247}{}{Why the hike?}
{248}{}{We have to make do. With the Tinsmiths gone, the whole caravan trail's messed up. We need to stock up on caps, or trading will be useless.}
{249}{}{Got it.}

# Water Exchange
{250}{}{Ya' need some water?}
{251}{}{No thanks, I'm okay.}
{252}{}{Yeah, definitely.}
{253}{}{I just need to refill my water supplies.}
{254}{}{Yes, I need to top off my water supply.}
{255}{}{Here ya' go. Use it wisely.}
{256}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}

{257}{}{Actually, I've got some questions.}
{258}{}{Listen, I jus' sell water. If ya' need answers, talk to my boss or someone else.}
{259}{}{Alright. Later.}
{260}{}{I'm on the trail of a slave convoy...}
{261}{}{I'm looking for a Tinsmith...}
{262}{}{I don't know shit about that. Do ya' need water or not?}
{263}{}{Nope, just passing through.}
{264}{}{Who's running this place?}
{265}{}{John Sullivan. He's in the generator room, fixing yet another breakdown.}
{266}{}{Got it. Thanks.}
{267}{}{How are you managing without your boss around?}
{268}{}{I'm handling things for him now. He did me a favor by "stepping down."}
{269}{}{I see. Good luck.}

{270}{}{Thanks for dealing with that maniac. He's been a problem for a while. Hopefully, this serves as a warning to others.}
{271}{}{No problem.}
{272}{}{It was a tough call.}
{273}{}{Here, take some clean water. Just keep this incident to yourself.}
{274}{}{Got it. Won't say a word.}
{1274}{}{Got it. Won't say a word.}
{275}{}{Don't mind that lunatic. He's had it coming for a long time. This should set an example.}
{276}{}{You've got a madhouse here.}
{277}{}{Not sure what to make of this.}
{278}{}{Just keep to yourself. Don't talk about it if ya' want to avoid trouble.}
{279}{}{Thanks for dealing with that psycho. I thought he was going to attack me. Here's some water. Keep quiet about this, alright?}
{280}{}{Why did that guy go after you?}
{281}{}{Trust me, yer' better off not knowing. There was a clan war over this pump in the past. He thought the water should be shared.}
{282}{}{I doubt that's the whole story.}
{283}{}{One of his kin died in that war... But like I said, it's none of your concern. And it's ancient history.}
{284}{}{That past almost got you killed. Just think about that.}
{285}{}{No point dwelling on old mistakes. We should focus on the future. Take care.}

# Water Dealings
{300}{}{I need a large batch of water.}
{301}{}{We don't sell in bulk to just anyone.}
{302}{}{Fine, forget it.}
{303}{}{What kind of rule is that?}
{304}{}{We reserve our stock for regular customers, especially in this heat.}
{305}{}{I run a business too. How about putting me on your list of partners?}
{306}{}{Business, huh? Ya' look like a drifter. Just take these bottles and be on your way.}
{307}{}{What kind of nonsense is that?}
{308}{}{You know what, forget it. I'm not buying anything out of principle. Bye.}
{309}{}{Alright, you know best.}
{310}{}{I'm looking for new trade partners. Let's start with a small order.}
{311}{}{Hmm. Alright. Let's see how it goes.}
{312}{}{You won't regret it, partner.}
{313}{}{By the glow of nuclear fission! You wouldn't deny a Follower's request, would you?}
{314}{}{Oh, yer' with that church? Your people pay well. Alright, I'll add ya' to the list.}
{315}{}{Thank you kindly.}
{316}{}{Come on, buddy. We're all in this together. Why the formalities?}
{317}{}{I don't know you that well.}
{318}{}{Then maybe it's time to start supporting the locals. What do you say?}
{319}{}{Heh, sure. Anything for you.}
{1319}{}{Heh, sure. Anything for you.}
{320}{}{Thanks a lot.}
{321}{}{You sell water to Two-Sun. Hard won't appreciate you turning me away.}
{322}{}{So, yer' the one the caravan folk talk about. The only outsider who's got the Tinsmiths' backing. Alright, we can do business.}
{323}{}{You won't regret it, partner.}
{324}{}{I fixed your filters. Doesn't that count for something?}
{325}{}{So yer' the one who did that? Nice work. This changes things.}
{326}{}{Alright, then sell me what you can.}

{330}{}{Hey, heard ya' took out the Blue Shields' leader. Is that true?}
{1330}{}{Hey, heard ya' took out the Blue Shields' leader. Is that true?}
{331}{}{Hey, did ya' really blow up the Blue Shields' tanks? Is that true?}
{332}{}{Yeah, it's true.}
{333}{}{Why, got a problem with it?}
{334}{}{Damn, yer' a hero around here now. If ya' need water, you'll get a good discount.}
{1334}{}{Damn, yer' a hero around here now. If ya' need water, you'll get a good discount.}
{335}{}{Thanks, I appreciate it.}
{336}{}{Should've started with that.}
{337}{}{The water merchant's cut his prices in half for you.}
