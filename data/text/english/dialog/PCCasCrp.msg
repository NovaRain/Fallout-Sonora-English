{100}{}{You see a roulette dealer in front of you.}
{101}{}{You see a girl with sharp eyes and a businesslike demeanor.}
{102}{}{Sorry, y-you can't sit at the roulette wheel in THAT...}
{103}{}{If you don't leave, I'll call security.}

{200}{}{(You see a nuclear-themed roulette table. The betting table is divided into black and red cells, with two cells labeled "0" and "00" highlighted with a mushroom cloud design. The dealer takes a bright yellow ball, aptly named a "bomb." With a habitual flick of his hand, she launches it along the wheel under the intense gaze of the players.)}
{201}{}{Uh, I don't know how to play this.}
{202}{}{I'll give it a try.}
{203}{}{I'm just watching, don't mind me.}
{204}{}{Of course, sir. Please join us.}
{1204}{}{Of course, ma'am. Please join us.}
{205}{}{So, what do we have here...}

{210}{}{Place your bets.}
{211}{}{I'm done for now.}
{212}{}{I'll place 5 chips on red.}
{213}{}{I'll place 5 chips on black.}
{214}{}{I'll place 5 chips on zero.}
{215}{}{I'm out of chips. I'll have to come back another time.}

{220}{}{Bets are done.}
{221}{}{Come on, little bomb, don't let me down.}
{222}{}{We'll see who gets lucky.}
{223}{}{Come on baby!}
{224}{}{Let's keep it going.}
{225}{}{Bombs away!}
{226}{}{Wait. I'm doubling my bet.}
{227}{}{Hold up. I'll triple my bet.}
{228}{}{Uh, sir?}
{1228}{}{Uh, please, ma'am?}
{229}{}{I think I'm out of chips. Okay, carry on without me.}

{230}{}{No more bets.}
{231}{}{[Wait]}
{232}{}{Bomb on red. You lose.}
{233}{}{Bomb on black. You lose.}
{234}{}{Bomb to zero! You lose.}
{235}{}{Double Zero Bomb! All bets go to the casino.}
{236}{}{I wanna play again.}
{237}{}{I think I've had enough for today.}
{238}{}{Bomb on red. You win.}
{239}{}{Bomb on black. You win.}
{240}{}{Bomb on zero. You win! The payout is 1 to 8.}
{241}{}{Great, let's keep at it!}
{242}{}{I'm done for noe. I need to take a break.}
