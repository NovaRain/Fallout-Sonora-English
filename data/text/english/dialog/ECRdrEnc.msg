{100}{}{You see a seasoned highwayman.}
{101}{}{This figure is one of the highway raiders, a nomad of the open road.}
{102}{}{Safe travels on your journey.}

{200}{}{Hey, thanks for the help, friend. Those guys had me running off-road for days. But why'd you lend a hand?}
{1200}{}{Hey, thanks for the help, friend. Those guys had me running off-road for days. But why'd you lend a hand?}
{201}{}{I believe in lending a hand when I can.}
{202}{}{Hah, don't feed me that do-gooder crap. People look out for themselves. But hey, if you're willing to stick your neck out for a stranger, I won't complain. Say, interested in meeting my crew? Our boss might wanna chat with you.}
{203}{}{What crew are you talking about?}
{204}{}{We're the Blue Shields. Named after those road signs you see around. Don't know 'em? Take a look at our base, just over there. Ben's our leader, go talk with him.}
{205}{}{Alright. Safe travels on your journey.}
{206}{}{I'm interested in joining your crew.}
{207}{}{Ha! Not the brightest idea, but hey, if you're dead set on it. Only folks who've hit rock bottom in the "civilized world" stick with us. Either way, it's Ben, our leader, who decides. You'll need to have a word with him.}
{208}{}{Got it. I'll find him.}
{209}{}{Base is over there. Ben's the man to talk to. Best of luck on your travels.}
{210}{}{Alright. Safe travels on your journey.}
{211}{}{Hey, thanks for the help, friend. Those bastards had me running off-road for days.}
{1211}{}{Hey, thanks for the help, friend. Those bastards had me running off-road for days.}
{212}{}{What were they after?}
{213}{}{Bounty hunters. Sometimes hired from Casa Grande or Phoenix to chase our gang off the highways. But these roads belong to us! They won't succeed.}
{214}{}{I see.}
{215}{}{I'll pass on the word to Ben and the crew. Catch you at the base.}
{216}{}{Safe travels on your journey.}
