{100}{}{You see someone on lookout.}
{101}{}{You see one of the runaway slaves, guarding the entrance.}

{200}{}{Hold it! How did you get past the traps?}
{201}{}{I had a map.}
{202}{}{Just lucky, I guess.}

{203}{}{Seriously? Alright then... What are you doing here?}
{1203}{}{Seriously? Alright then... What are you doing here?}
{204}{}{I don't buy it. But fine... What's your business here?}

{205}{}{I need to talk to your leader.}
{206}{}{We don't have a leader. We're all equals here. Are you another escapee, or spying for the Tinsmiths? Alright, go see Jeff, he handles our tactics. Let's see what he thinks of you.}
{207}{}{Sure. We'll have plenty to discuss.}
{208}{}{I've already seen enough. Time for you to die.}
{1208}{}{I've already seen enough. Time for you to die.}
{209}{}{Just one thing - making you disappear from these ruins.}

{210}{}{Come on in, but don't get any ideas about betraying us.}
{211}{}{Got it.}
{212}{}{Later.}
{213}{}{Spy! Everyone, get over here!}
{214}{}{You're making a mistake.}

{220}{}{How did you end up here?}
{221}{}{I was captured in Phoenix and sold to the Tinsmiths as a slave. They sent us to the Forbidden Zone to scavenge old tech. Luckily, Jeff helped me escape. Now I'm here, doing what I can. I'm valued for my skill with traps.}
{222}{}{Just got grabbed, huh? Sounds a bit fishy.}
{223}{}{Ever heard of those fire worshipper fanatics? They don't see wastelanders as people. If they need slaves, they'll collar anyone, doesn't matter who.}
{224}{}{How'd you get good with traps?}
{225}{}{Jeff taught me. I never asked who taught him.}
{226}{}{What can you tell me about Jeff?}
{227}{}{Jeff's a serious guy, a real lifesaver. Without him, we'd be dead in the Forbidden Zone or starving somewhere. He's got a knack for finding supplies when it seems impossible.}

#Traps
{230}{}{How do I get out of here without setting off traps?}
{231}{}{Take the back door. That's all I'm telling you.}
{232}{}{Got it.}
{233}{}{We're on the same side, you know.}
{234}{}{Alright, I'll show you the traps. Be careful.}
{235}{}{Thanks.}
{236}{}{You already know too much.}
{237}{}{Okay...}
