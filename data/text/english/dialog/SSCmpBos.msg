{210}{}{Dossier on Private Corwin}
{211}{}{Name: Alvin Corwin. Rank: Initiate. Unit: Candidate Paladin. Health Status: Normal.}
{212}{}{On behalf of Paladin Dixon, issue a leave order for Initiate E. Corwin.}
{213}{}{Order accepted.}
{214}{}{Perfect. I'll go give Alvin the good news.}

{220}{}{Open Dixon's message.}
{221}{}{"The world needs strength - true strength - to rise from its knees and march forward, and only the Brotherhood can provide that. But for too long, we've remained cloistered, hiding our power from a world in chaos. When California faced the super mutants, it was us who stood between civilization and annihilation. Now, our order must claim what it needs. Lost Hills demands Sonora's resources and technology, and we will answer the call."}
{222}{}{Mission: "Flag of the Nation".}

{223}{}{"Securing Arizona's wild lands demands decisive action. We need the whole of this fractured territory to be brought under one vision - ours. Installing Brotherhood-friendly governance in critical locations will ensure our influence. Should any ungrateful locals resist, we'll adjust their attitudes as necessary. Reeducation awaits."}

{225}{}{Our mandate in Phoenix is simple: establish unquestionable Brotherhood authority and create a hidden advisory council led by a Brotherhood representative. No one outside the Brotherhood needs to know who truly pulls the strings."}
{226}{}{Operation: Wind of War}
{227}{}{Our Nogales outpost will become a bulwark, controlling the Mexican border and monitoring cross-border threats. Intelligence tells us the settlement faces the Mexican army - excellent. Let them come; the Brotherhood fears no one."}
{228}{}{Our Main Goal}
{229}{}{"The primary objective remains: gather Sonora's technology and nuclear resources for Lost Hills. Arizona's rich resources will power our defenses against the super mutants and future threats. As High Paladin here, I hold the authority to make any decision necessary to secure these assets."}

{240}{}{Read Dixon's diary.}
{241}{}{"...California's General Headquarters didn't send me to Arizona to play the role of a savior. They sent me to claim what's been squandered by those too ignorant to understand the value of what they sit on. Pre-war tech and resources are wasted on these people, and it falls to us to make sure nothing more is lost."}
{242}{}{"...The scribes might prattle about peace, but this mission was always about conquest. The locals cling to their relics and deny us what's rightfully ours. Phoenix's capture was bloody because it had to be. Strength - true Brotherhood strength - brings peace only when it's carved out of weakness."}
{243}{}{"...Lost Hills may balk at these measures, but how else can they expect Arizona to supply what they need? Nuclear fuel moves from Flagstaff's mine to Two-Sun's workshops, then through the wastes to our outpost. We'll press whatever labor we need to keep it moving. These desert-bound settlers have the luxury to question morals; I have a war to wage."}
{244}{}{"...Arizona's traditions are embedded too deeply, and its people cling to their traditions with the tenacity of weeds. After years of effort, we established our foothold in Phoenix under the guise of the cult of Aaron, yet dissent still simmers. We've brought the Tinsmiths of Two-Sun into line, but it's a tenuous alliance at best. Time is of the essence now; we take what's needed - everything."}
