{100}{}{You see merchant Marco.}
{101}{}{You see the caravan manager. His weathered skin speaks of countless miles traveled through the wasteland.}
{102}{}{Safe travels.}
{103}{}{This settlement is called Two-Sun. Locals are wary of outsiders, so mind your manners.}

{200}{}{Hello. What can I do for you?}
{201}{}{Are you the manager of this caravan?}
{202}{}{Yes. But if you need transportation services, look for someone else. I try not to get distracted by small orders.}
{203}{}{I see. Looks like your business is booming.}

{210}{}{What do you need?}
{211}{}{Nothing.}
{212}{}{Let's move on.}
{213}{}{Got it.}

#Questions
{220}{}{What are you doing?}
{221}{}{I'm prepping for departure and waiting on the rest of the cargo. My clients are meticulous, keeping detailed records of every damn nut and bolt we transport.}
{222}{}{How long have you been driving caravans?}
{223}{}{About six years. I've got a nose for a "uranium vein." Back then, no one believed contracts with Tinsmiths would be a regular thing. I was lucky to get the gig early on.}
{224}{}{What are you transporting?}
{225}{}{Tinsmiths mainly want uranium ore, food, and medicine. They trade these for tech items, which they assemble or repair in their workshops.}
{226}{}{What about slaves?}
{227}{}{Not my line of work. Slaves are too much hassle. That kind of task usually goes to special convoys organized by the mercenary guild or recruits from the local population.}
{228}{}{Who are these Tinsmiths?}
{229}{}{A strange, introverted group obsessed with technology. They fix ancient machines and repair broken equipment. Their skills are unmatched in all of Arizona.}
{230}{}{Where is their settlement?}
{231}{}{Two-Sun. That's what they call their city. Head south along Interstate 10, you can't miss it.}
{232}{}{Thanks.}
{233}{}{Who are your clients?}
{234}{}{I was hired by the Followers of Fire. End your questions here. I have a rule - don't discuss clients with the first person I meet.}
{235}{}{Okay, forget it.}
{236}{}{Who are the Tinsmiths?}

{240}{}{Damn it! Why did the Followers have to fall like this, just when business started booming?}
{241}{}{Were they that important to your caravan?}
{242}{}{After the Followers, no one will want to do business with me. We only worked with them. Plus, without the Followers, the Tinsmiths will likely reduce their output. Hell, the entire economy of Phoenix might collapse because of some ridiculous explosion. What the hell happened to them there?}
{243}{}{Who knows? I generally mind my own business. Bye.}
{244}{}{I had nothing to do with this! It's definitely not because of me.}
{245}{}{Well of course. As if the Followers could be taken out by some ordinary wastelander. Oh well.}
{246}{}{Whew, I thought for a second you uh... suspected me. That's a relief. Welp, bye.}
{247}{}{Do you think maybe they blew themselves up?}
{248}{}{Well, that's one theory. They were advanced with all this nuclear tech. Rumor has it they were assembling a nuke in the cathedral's basement. Maybe something went wrong - and this is the result.}
{249}{}{But why does this bother you so much? Did your caravan depend on the temple?}

{250}{}{I'm looking for some slaves. They were brought from the Flagstaff colony.}
{251}{}{Straight from the colony? Oh... Well, I drive caravans and have nothing to do with slaves. You'd better talk to someone in town.}
{252}{}{Like who? Who handles stuff like this here?}
{253}{}{You'll find someone in the mercenary guild. It's in the business center, to the left through the city gate.}
{254}{}{I guess I'll have to try that. Goodbye.}
{255}{}{Thanks, bye.}

#Escort
{300}{}{I need to get to Two-Sun.}
{301}{}{Why would we take you along? An extra tail will only slow us down on the road.}
{302}{}{Caravanners should help each other.}
{303}{}{Do you know how to get to Puerto Penasco?}
{304}{}{As a Follower of Fire, I can be *positive* influence on your future contracts.}
{305}{}{Too bad. But I did have a couple of other questions.}
{306}{}{So, are you just another adventurer looking to scavenge the remnants of the Tinsmiths? Your call, but we've postponed any trips to Two-Sun for now.}
{1306}{}{So, are you just another adventurer looking to scavenge the remnants of the Tinsmiths? Your call, but we've postponed any trips to Two-Sun for now.}
{307}{}{I see. So you won't help me.}
{308}{}{Perhaps. But not in your case.}
{309}{}{I think I heard about that place from the Tinsmiths in Two-Sun. They trade with Puer... Puerd... whatever it's called, but I don't know anything else.}

{310}{}{Alright. Seems like your coming with us. But remember, Tinsmiths guard their settlement well and don't tolerate idle strangers. You'll need a good reason to get inside.}
{311}{}{When are we heading out?}
{312}{}{Get ready by 6 am. Carry no more than 150 pounds of cargo. And remember, we'll stop at Casa Grande whether you like it or not.}
{313}{}{I'm ready to go.}
{314}{}{I'll be there by 6 am.}
{315}{}{You're carrying too much. No one's gonna carry your stuff for you. Shed the extra weight or we'll leave without you.}
{316}{}{The extra weight'll be my problem.}
{317}{}{Whatever you say.}
{318}{}{Alright, move your brahmin asses, we've got a long way to go!}
{319}{}{[Begin the journey]}
{320}{}{Maybe so. Or maybe not. Lose the weight.}
{321}{}{Okay, I'll take another look at my pack.}
{322}{}{I'll pay 1000 caps for an escort.}
{323}{}{That's a significant amount. Are you sure you have that many caps?}
{324}{}{Let me count...}
{325}{}{I'm on an important assignment for the Church of the Holy Fire.}
{326}{}{I see. Bye.}

#Other locations
{400}{}{This is a great place to rest on your way to Two-Sun. We'll replenish our water supplies, spend the night, and move on. If you're late for departure, we won't wait for you.}
{401}{}{Can you tell me anything about this settlement?}
{402}{}{Casa Grande is a small town, usually just a stop-over between Two-Sun and Phoenix. Its main attraction is the water pump up the street. It's rare to find a source of fresh, clean water like this in the wasteland.}
{403}{}{See you later.}
{404}{}{[Wait for the caravan to leave for Two-Sun]}
{405}{}{Leave without me, I've got stuff to do here.}
{406}{}{As you wish. We won't wait.}
{407}{}{I see, bye.}
