{100}{}{You see Arthur Carrington.}
{101}{}{You see an archaeologist in a torn, dirty robe. Despite his shabby appearance, he stands firm.}
{102}{}{Were you trying to break into the vault? Then stay here FOREVER!}

{110}{}{This is where I'd choose to live forever.}
{111}{}{A surviving pre-war laboratory? Incredible! How did I not know about this place before?}
{112}{}{I'm curious, is this power plant still operational?}
{113}{}{Holy saints! These bandits have taken up residence inside the power plant, like bugs in an old hotel.}
{114}{}{I can't believe my eyes - the whole valley is littered with priceless ancient technologies!}
{115}{}{This looks like the center of the Forbidden Zone. Robots must have been operating here since the Great War.}
{116}{}{These guys don't just read books. Who are they?}

#Before the escape (in the reactor room)
{200}{}{I was expecting rescuers from Phoenix, but who are YOU?}
{201}{}{I'm a peasant from Villa. My ancestors are somehow connected with this vault. And I'm here to find out how.}
{1201}{}{I'm a peasant girl from Villa. My ancestors are somehow connected with this vault. And I'm here to find out how.}
{202}{}{Impressive that you made it this far. You know, I heard about this story with Villa. But if you want to know the details, then help me finish my business in this vault.}
{203}{}{What's your business here?}
{204}{}{So I was talking to *you* on the intercom? Well, your work is impressive. It's a shame we didn't meet earlier.}
{205}{}{Come this far just to turn around? I don't think so.}
{206}{}{That's exactly what I thought when I led the expedition on its last foray. As you can see, it was a mistake.}
{207}{}{Tell me what happened.}
{208}{}{I don't think now is the right time to talk. I'll tell you everything, but first I need to finish what I started.}
{209}{}{What are you talking about?}
{210}{}{Now is not the time to talk. Pack your things, we're leaving.}
{211}{}{I completely agree. But first we need to finish what we started.}
{212}{}{I must infiltrate the overseer's post. That room is located on a higher level. Follow me. We shouldn't waste time. Oh, yes, my name is Arthur Carrington. Glad to meet you.}
{213}{}{Is this really necessary...}
{214}{}{Okay. But don't try anything funny.}

#Before the escape (at the overseer's post)
{220}{}{Damn it! All this way for a complete failure?}
{221}{}{What's going on? You look distraught.}
{222}{}{Are you talking to yourself? 'Cause I'm kind of interested too.}
{223}{}{Protocol Zero.}
{224}{}{Protocol... what?}
{225}{}{What the hell is Protocol Zero?}
{226}{}{I suspected it would end like this. Long years of isolation drove the overseer mad, and he initiated a chain of procedures to destroy the vault. The so-called "Protocol Zero".}
{227}{}{But some of the equipment still works.}
{228}{}{It seems his plans weren't much more successful than yours.}
{229}{}{Yes, that's right. Apparently, the residents resisted the overseer's actions and were able to stop some of the procedures. They saved their lives but doomed themselves to many years of terrible suffering, becoming... like undead... zombies.}
{230}{}{I think they were suffering long before that happened too.}
{231}{}{If we stick around here, we might end up like them.}
{232}{}{Yeah... right... Look, I need to get to the surface. I don't think there's anything of value left here. I see no point in exposing myself to further danger. Together we have a better chance of making it out. Will you help me?}
{233}{}{Let's go. I'll get you to the surface.}
{234}{}{Very good. You lead. I'm not much for combat, but I'll keep an eye on the rear.}
{235}{}{Go ahead.}

#During the escape
{250}{}{Let's not linger here.}
{251}{}{Time to move on.}

{260}{}{Can you tell me anything about this room?}
{261}{}{This is the reactor level. Once upon a time, the reactor overheated and melted down, destroying part of the level. Fortunately, the rock protects us from its powerful radiation.}
{262}{}{This is the service level. The vault control center and various support services were located here. I'd love to see all this technological splendor in its original form.}
{263}{}{Education Center. The library is in electronic form. The amazing ingenuity of our ancestors.}
{264}{}{This is the entertainment hall. But it seems that because of overpopulation, it was utilized for extra living quarters, rather than recreation.}
{265}{}{This is the overseer's post, the vault 'manager', one might say. From here it was possible to control all the vault systems. Nothing is working here now - it looks like the overseer destroyed the equipment with an electromagnetic pulse explosion.}
{266}{}{This is one of the residential levels. Apart from the sleeping quarters, there's nothing much here.}
{267}{}{I had another question.}

{270}{}{You saved me. Without you, I would have been stuck there forever, maybe evening doomed to become one of those... zombies. It's made me look at what's important in life a bit differently.}
{1270}{}{You saved me. Without you, I would have been stuck there forever, maybe evening doomed to become one of those... zombies. It's made me look at what's important in life a bit differently.}
{271}{}{Anyway, you're free now. Time to help those still breathing.}
{272}{}{Just "a bit"? Seems life ain't teaching you much, Mister Scientist.}
{273}{}{I can't repay you right now, but when I get to Phoenix, I'll tell my friends in the Cathedral of Fire about you. You should visit there too. But... Uhm... I'll need help getting to Phoenix. Care to join me?}
{274}{}{Sure, let's head to Phoenix. Why not?}
{275}{}{Thanks. You're saving me again. If we're going together, I can carry some gear. I also wouldn't mind some detours to interesting places along the way.}
{276}{}{Great. Let's move, Arthur.}
{277}{}{Whatever you do, don't run off without me.}
{278}{}{I'd love to have you on the team. But what about those answers you promised?}
{279}{}{I heard there's trouble at the Cathedral. We better get moving.}
{1279}{}{I heard there's trouble at the Cathedral. We better get moving.}
{280}{}{Actually, I'm not heading to Phoenix anytime soon.}
{281}{}{No problem. Drop me at the nearest settlement, and I'll find my way. I can carry some things, and wouldn't mind seeing some interesting places along the way.}
{282}{}{Consider yourself on the team. Let's go, Arthur.}
{283}{}{Then you're carrying all my stuff. And don't complain. Move out!}
{284}{}{Welcome to the team. Now, can we talk about those answers you promised?}

# After the escape
{300}{}{What's going on?}
{301}{}{Okay, let's look at these equations... Oops, did I miss something?}
{302}{}{Answers are never enough.}
{303}{}{Need more sage advice?}
{304}{}{Are we in Phoenix yet?}
{305}{}{Hey, your route's looking a bit off.}
{306}{}{What do you need?}
{307}{}{My plans went sideways long ago.}
{308}{}{I don't mind chatting. But can we mix in a bit of Latin?}
{309}{}{Let's keep moving, Arthur.}

{310}{}{I'm feeling off. Must be the poison.}
{311}{}{Let me... bend over... Now like this... Feeling better?}
{312}{}{Yeah... Thanks, Doc.}

# Questions
{320}{}{I have a lot of questions for you.}
{321}{}{Oh, of course. And I've got plenty of answers.}
{322}{}{Of course. Ask away.}
{323}{}{These answers will do.}
{333}{}{One more question.}
{334}{}{Where's Phoenix?}
{335}{}{You really don't know? Odd... Hold out your Pip-Boy, I'll mark it on the map.}
{336}{}{Thanks.}

{350}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{351}{}{Haven't I introduced myself? Arthur Carrington, expedition leader. I'm a free scientist of sorts.}
{352}{}{Where'd you get your education?}
{353}{}{My parents taught me reading and computer skills. It's rare around here, so folks in Phoenix valued my services. When the Church of the Holy Fire took over, I had opportunities for science I'd only dreamed of.}
{354}{}{Who were your parents?}
{355}{}{I think they were descendants of vault dwellers, though they never said outright.}
{356}{}{Why did you go on the expedition?}
{357}{}{The Fire worshippers wanted scouts for practical finds - old tech, energy sources, weapons. As a scientist, I saw broader potential. The vault held secrets of the Old World that could aid the New. We shouldn't discard ancient relics so lightly.}

{360}{}{Tell me what happened to the expedition.}
{361}{}{We split into two groups - one to check the backup generator, and the other, led by me, went to the reactor. Things went south after that.}
{362}{}{What happened to your group?}
{363}{}{We got to the reactor and started exploring. There was a... trap I guess. The explosion killed my team and knocked me out. When I came to, the elevator was up, power off, no contact with the first group.}
{364}{}{What happened to the first group?}
{365}{}{They were likely attacked by zombies. You'd know better than me. The generator couldn't fail on its own. One of the zombies must have pulled the fusion cells, leaving me trapped.}
{366}{}{I found your group. One had a bullet wound to the head. Explain that.}
{1366}{}{I found your group. One had a bullet wound to the head. Explain that.}
{367}{}{Why dig through dirty laundry? I wasn't the only survivor. Another was wounded, but caring for him would drain my resources. I couldn't afford it.}
{368}{}{Seems like you played it safe while your team perished.}
{369}{}{Caution kept me alive. Only in the vault did my ambitions get the best of me. I had to act, the expedition was at risk - the cult could let me go or replace me if I failed. I couldn't let that happen!}

{370}{}{What do you know about 'zombies'?}
{371}{}{I'd say they're the unfortunate results of complications from the "Protocol Zero": toxic gases, airborne viruses, radiation, meds, and more. They stayed in a limbo for decades until we disturbed them. Their minds rotted away, leaving nothing but primal instincts.}
{372}{}{Did you notice I mutated into something similar?}
{1372}{}{Did you notice I mutated into something similar?}
{373}{}{Similar, though distinct. I did almost take you for one of them when we met. You've got a long, strange life ahead of you.}

{380}{}{I want to know about the vault's connection to the Villa.}
{381}{}{Sorry, I lied to get you to save me. I don't know anything about the Villa or how vault stuff ended up there. Probably someone left the vault ages ago, and their stuff drifted your way. Happens all the time.}
{382}{}{[More]}
{383}{}{You'll need to go back down and look for clues yourself. Here, take this access card. It'll open the locked doors.}
{384}{}{You shouldn't have lied to me. Consider this your first and last warning.}
{385}{}{Thanks for the card, at least. I'll check it out.}
{386}{}{Go back down into that hellhole? This is going to be tough.}

{390}{}{What's your next move?}
{391}{}{I'll write a big report and try to squeeze more resources out of the cult to finish the expedition. I need reliable security to clear the vault of zombies and a fresh batch of slaves.}
{392}{}{I see. Do what you want.}
{393}{}{A lot of people died because of your ambition. Do you really want to push on?}
{394}{}{As harsh as it sounds, the lives of mercenaries and slaves are worth less than the legacy of the old world. Think of the doors we'll open by bringing forgotten tech back to Phoenix!}
{395}{}{Did that tech help the vault's zombies?}
{396}{}{No, it didn't help them. So what? It was just the foolishness of one vault overseer.}
{397}{}{Okay. As you say.}
{398}{}{Technology didn't save the vault dwellers. It doomed them to a living hell.}
{399}{}{What do you mean?}
{400}{}{Technology won't save a corrupt society. It'll just spark wars for its power.}
{401}{}{Hmm... Never thought of that. Phoenix is changing under the Fire Cult. Old tech benefits but also divides us... Maybe I should read up on sociology.}
{402}{}{Just thinking out loud. Forget it.}
{403}{}{This wraps up our chat. Bye.}
{404}{}{Glad you're seeing things more clearly. Now, about those other questions...}

#THE CONSIGNMENT
{450}{}{I need your help. Come with me.}
{451}{}{Sorry, but no. Too many people mess with my plans.}
{452}{}{Hmmm... I see.}
{453}{}{Time to part ways. You're on your own from here.}
{454}{}{Leaving me after all we've been through? Fine. I'll just read my pocket book until you change your mind.}
{455}{}{Stay put.}
{456}{}{You can take off your armor.}
{457}{}{Thanks. It's pretty stuffy.}
{458}{}{That's it.}
{459}{}{Stash your weapon.}
{460}{}{Whatever you say.}
{461}{}{That's it.}
{462}{}{Maybe I'll come back for you later.}
{463}{}{We've made it to Phoenix. Q.E.D. With folks like you on the expedition, I wouldn't have failed.}
{464}{}{What's next for you?}
{465}{}{I've got a lot on my plate. First, I need to meet with the client and report my findings. That'll take a few days. Till then, I'll be busy.}
{466}{}{Okay. We'll regroup here in two days.}
{467}{}{Hail to my savior.}
{468}{}{Bye, Arthur.}

{470}{}{Here comes my savior. Good to see you.}
{1470}{}{Here comes my savior. Good to see you.}
{471}{}{How'd your report go? You don't look too thrilled.}
{472}{}{There's no one to report to. The Cathedral of Fire is destroyed. Gone. I don't know what happened, but the fire worshippers are on the run, and no one needs a scientist like me.}
{473}{}{Are you sure?}
{474}{}{I have one lead. I found vague reports about a city of scientists to the south. I want to look for it and maybe find... a home. If you're heading that way, I'd like to tag along.}
{475}{}{South huh? I'll think about it.}
{476}{}{Oh, by the way, I snagged some Rad-X and stimpaks from the lab. Take them as a small thank you for saving me.}
{477}{}{Thanks. See you around.}
{480}{}{Is this the place you were talking about?}
{481}{}{This is it! A city of science and progress, a real oasis in the desert. Even the air's different. Perfect for my research.}
{482}{}{So, it's time to part ways?}
{483}{}{Yes. Let's check our bags. Do I still have any of your stuff? I'm heading staight into the town to get settled in as soon as I can.}
{484}{}{[More]}
{485}{}{I'm glad we met. I never imagined a wastelander would teach me the most important lesson: to value human life. I used to chase science for fortune and glory. Now it's time to do something truly meaningful.}
{486}{}{Goodbye, Arthur.}
{487}{}{The client was furious with my report. I was chastised for waste and inefficiency, even threatened with burning at the stake. How was I to know the vault had those... "zombies", or was so wrecked? They said the expedition's costs weren't justified. Damn money-grubbers! Looks like my scientific career ends here.}

# added to fix arthur recognizing Casa Nueva
{488}{}{Well, I think I'd like to head back to Casa Nueva. Something about that place really hit me. I think I could make a life there, a home. If you're heading that way, I'd like to tag along. }
{489}{}{Here we are. Your new home sweet home.}
