{100}{}{You see the elder Nana.}
{101}{}{You see a priestess in traditional attire.}
{102}{}{Leave. We are not afraid of you and your iron toys.}

# First meeting
{200}{}{Stop. We no longer allow outsiders into camp.}
{201}{}{Stop, outsider. We warned you to leave our land. Why do you continue to trouble us?}
{202}{}{I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm pursuing a convoy with slaves taken from my home, Villa. It might have passed through here.}
{203}{}{So you are from Villa? I have heard of your village! We have never been enemies. But we have never been friends either.}
{204}{}{I actually knew nothing about you.}
{1204}{}{I actually knew nothing about you.}
{205}{}{Then we should learn more of each other.}
{206}{}{So your people have met same fate as many others? I am sorry. But you will not find your kin here.}
{207}{}{Are slavers troubling you as well?}
{208}{}{I'm here looking for Villa's people. So you better not interfere with my search.}
{209}{}{So you are from Villa? I have heard of your village. We have never been enemies. We should not start now.}
{210}{}{If you know where the slavers are holding my people, then speak up.}
{211}{}{So slavers have also broken your village? I am sorry. You are not first to suffer this fate. But you will not find your people here.}
{212}{}{Are slavers troubling you as well?}
{213}{}{Madre... padre... Are you here? I search so far!}
{214}{}{Oh, poor child. Perhaps the Dark Brahmin of Radiation has cursed the seed of your kin. I feel sorry for you.}
{215}{}{Bra-Min? No-no, father's name is Andres!}
{216}{}{Go to our high chief, Geronimo. Speak to him. He is wise and may be able to help you.}
{217}{}{I will go to big chief.}

{220}{}{They name themselves missionaries. They came to our lands and force their rules on us. We resist, but price for freedom grows high. We stand on edge of war with pale-skinned city folk from Phoenix.}
{221}{}{There's plenty of space in the wastelands. Why can't you share?}
{222}{}{They want to force us to their will, to take our brahmin, and use us for cheap labor. But we are not like brahmin that obey any man with whip.}
{223}{}{We're similar to you. The Villa also values its freedom. But it was taken from us by force.}
{224}{}{Then we should listen to each other's words. Talk to our high chief, Geronimo. He does not speak with outsiders. But you are from neighboring tribe. And neighbors should live in peace.}
{225}{}{Alright. Where can I find the chief?}
{226}{}{Go to large house with columns. Our 'Sanctuary'. I will let chief know that you come. But do not disturb other tribespeople until you gain their trust.}
{227}{}{Alright. See you.}
{228}{}{I'm looking for Ranger Oscar. I was sent to assist him.}
{229}{}{We are thankful for what the Rangers do for our freedom. Lately, we have been on the edge of war with the missionaries. Speak on this with our high chief, Geronimo.}

{230}{}{What did Geronimo say?}
{231}{}{I haven't spoken to him yet.}
{1231}{}{I haven't spoken to him yet.}
{232}{}{Go to Geronimo. I will not speak more with you until he gives word you can stay.}
{233}{}{Alright.}
{234}{}{Can I talk to you first?}
{235}{}{No. Go to Geronimo. I will not speak more with you until he gives word you can stay.}
{236}{}{Alright.}
{237}{}{Where can I find the chief?}
{238}{}{In large building with columns and face of Great Brahmin. Go straight; you cannot lose your way.}
{239}{}{Got it.}
{240}{}{He thinks we must unite against Phoenix.}
{241}{}{Wise words. This problem affects all of us - both our tribe and your Villa. I hope you can help us.}
{242}{}{Yes. We'll see what can be done.}

# Repeated dialogue
{250}{}{I listen to you, peasant from Villa.}
{1250}{}{I listen to you, peasant woman from Villa.}
{251}{}{Speak, peasant from Villa.}
{1251}{}{Speak, peasant woman from Villa.}
{252}{}{I need to go. Goodbye, Nana.}

{260}{}{I want you to support an alliance with the Phoenix missionaries.}
{261}{}{I did not expect you to take their side. But I see no reason to embrace snake. Phoenix will betray our tribe as soon as it brings benefit to them.}
{262}{}{I don't know what to say. Maybe you're right.}
{263}{}{Open your eyes - Phoenix is better than the Rangers for the entire tribe.}
{264}{}{We have lived without Phoenix before, and we will live on. I stand against this alliance.}
{265}{}{You'll regret this. Mark my words.}
{266}{}{Alright. Let's not argue.}
{267}{}{The Rangers are treacherous. They're using you for their war. And Phoenix offers a trade alliance and solutions to many problems.}
{268}{}{Hmm. I had not thought about it that way before. Your words open my eyes. Yes, you can count on my vote at the council of elders.}
{269}{}{You won't regret your choice.}
{270}{}{Excellent, that's all I needed.}
{271}{}{An alliance would solve many of your problems.}
{272}{}{Maybe so. But to become part of empire, we will lose ourselves. More importantly, we will have no defence against outsiders. What will we do if we are betrayed? How will we protect ourselves?}
{273}{}{You need strength. You need weapons.}
{274}{}{Yes. Weapons that Phoenix will not give us. If we had 'rifles' that kill a healthy man with one shot, we would not fear any alliances.}
{275}{}{I'll bring you three hunting rifles. In return, you'll support the alliance at the council of elders.}
{276}{}{So be it. Get us outsiders' weapons, and I will stand by your side.}
{277}{}{Deal.}
{278}{}{Good. I'm on it.}
{1278}{}{Good. I'm on it.}
{279}{}{Alright. I like to keep a good supply of weapons.}

{280}{}{I have some weapons for you.}
{281}{}{Show me what you have brought.}
{1281}{}{Show me what you have brought.}
{282}{}{Not now.}
{283}{}{.}
{290}{}{Alright. But it is not enough.}
{291}{}{I'll bring more.}
{292}{}{Good. That is enough. You have my vote at council of elders.}
{293}{}{Geronimo makes alliance with Rangers. I should not have heard your words. I should have stood against this alliance.}
{294}{}{We both made mistakes. It happens.}
{295}{}{This mistake could cost many lives.}
{296}{}{Yeah. Goodbye.}
{297}{}{Ah, sorry. I forget that you savages are so gullible. Used to having your chiefs make all the decisions for you, huh?}
{298}{}{I will pray to the Divine Brahmin to send snakes on your path on your journey.}
{299}{}{Yeah. Goodbye.}

# Interrogation
{310}{}{Who are you?}
{311}{}{I am Nana, elder of southern clan of my tribe.}
{312}{}{It was nice to meet you, Nana.}
{313}{}{Are there other elders?}
{314}{}{Right now in camp, it is me, Genaro, Mangas, and high Chief Geronimo.}
{315}{}{Tell me about Genaro.}
{316}{}{He manages brahmin pens and rarely leaves camp. He knows Phoenix outsiders and their customs better than anyone else.}
{317}{}{Tell me about Mangas.}
{318}{}{Be careful with Mangas. He hates anything that threatens our traditions.}
{319}{}{Tell me about Chief Geronimo.}
{320}{}{Great chief. He united scattered tribes to face new enemy. Before him, tribes fought over land and brahmin. Now we live as one family.}
{321}{}{I met Chatto here. What can you tell me about him?}
{322}{}{Chief's son is important warrior in camp. Youth stand behind him. Together, they seek change. I do not like that foolishness.}
{323}{}{Alright.}
