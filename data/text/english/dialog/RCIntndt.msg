{100}{}{You see Henry.}
{101}{}{You see the Rangers' quartermaster.}
{102}{}{Who's there? Hold up! I'm armed!}

#First Dialogue
{200}{}{For the last time, no, I DON'T know where that fucki... Oh, I thought you were the inspector again.}
{201}{}{Uh, no, I'm definitely not the inspector.}
{202}{}{I won't take it personally. For now.}
{203}{}{Hmm, a new face. Didn't expect that. Name's Henry, I'm the quartermaster here. Keep in mind there are strict rules. Follow them if you want to stick around.}
{204}{}{Now you're telling me what to do?}
{205}{}{Got it, no problem.}
{206}{}{Hold on, ain't we talked about some fool messing with Ranger graves recently? Any idea who's behind it?}
{207}{}{Me? Uh, no, sir.}
{208}{}{Too bad. Rangers are offering a rifle to anyone who finds and nails that bastard. Keep that in mind.}
{209}{}{Uh, yeah, sure, sir.}

#Re-Dialogue
{210}{}{So what brings you here?}
{211}{}{Nothing, for now.}
{212}{}{Enough small talk. Let's get down to business.}
{213}{}{I'm still curious about your story.}
{220}{}{I'd like to hear your story.}
{221}{}{You're really interested in my life story?}
{222}{}{What's your role around here?}
{223}{}{I'm the quartermaster.}
{224}{}{Do you trade with outsiders?}
{225}{}{Sorry, but Command ain't keen on casual trade with outsiders. We got caravans for supplies. But the mess in San Brahmin's put a dent in trading lately.}
{226}{}{What's going on in San Brahmin?}
{227}{}{We trade with the herders there for leather and meat. But there's trouble brewing. Dunno how it'll play out.}
{228}{}{I've got connections there. I could be a good partner.}
{229}{}{We'll see how it pans out.}
{230}{}{Thanks.}
{231}{}{Doubt your biz is Ranger material.}
{232}{}{Ok, whatever you say...}
{233}{}{}
{234}{}{Where are you from?}
{235}{}{Family moved a lot. Came from the west.}
{236}{}{Tell me about the west.}
{237}{}{Southern California? Hellish compared to here. Ruined cities, barren soil, and cannibals running wild. Pop's higher than in Arizona, though.}
{238}{}{How did you end up a Ranger?}
{239}{}{Wasteland separated me from my family. Rangers saved my hide. Been helping 'em ever since. Guess this life suits me.}

#Ranger
{250}{}{Looks like I need to register with you. I'm a new recruit.}
{251}{}{Heard about your initiation, Ranger. Impressive how quickly you earned it.}
{252}{}{[Next]}
{253}{}{Alright, if you need anything, just speak up. I'll set you up with a bunk, but be careful with your gear. Here's your leather armor and a canteen for your travels. Now, what weapon do you prefer?}
{254}{}{[Hunting rifle with ammo]}
{255}{}{[Signal pistol with flares]}
{256}{}{[Throwing knives, 5 blades]}
{257}{}{Sign here. Keep in mind, this is all you get.}
{258}{}{Thanks, I'll take good care of this gear.}
{259}{}{Just like I thought. Hand it over.}

{270}{}{Rufus mentioned a reward for me?}
{271}{}{Yep, he authorized me to offer you something. Take your pick from this list.}
{272}{}{Maybe later.}
{273}{}{3 Stimpaks}
{274}{}{35 rounds of .44 caliber}
{275}{}{20 rounds of .308 caliber}
{276}{}{Leather armor.}
{277}{}{}
{278}{}{Here you go.}
{279}{}{Thanks.}

{280}{}{I'm heading to Puerto for a scouting mission..}
{281}{}{Good luck. Our Rangers down that way are worried. New enemy's tough.}
{282}{}{Got it.}
{283}{}{We're spreading propaganda in settlements and paying for enemy kills. Show proof, get caps.}
{284}{}{What kind of proof?}
{285}{}{Each one's got a dog tag. Bring 'em here, get paid. Simple.}
{286}{}{Got it.}
{287}{}{I've got a Brotherhood of Steel dog tag.}
{288}{}{Every enemy down means more freedom for Arizona. Here's your reward - 10 caps per tag.}
{289}{}{Not much, but it'll do. Here's the tag.}
{290}{}{I don't do it for the caps. Keep 'em.}
{291}{}{Every tag boosts Ranger morale. Thanks, and good luck out there.}
{292}{}{See you around.}
{293}{}{Hold up, I had something else to discuss.}

#Quest for the loss
{300}{}{About the inspector. Did something go missing?}
{301}{}{Yes... According to the manifests, there should be a Colt 6520 pistol and a box of ammo for it. But they're gone.}
{302}{}{Got it. I'll leave you to it.}
{303}{}{A mistake in the records, maybe?}
{304}{}{Doubt it. I don't even want to think that one of our own could've stolen it. But that's the only explanation.}
{305}{}{I could help you find it. Who was the last person to use it?}
{306}{}{It's probably just misplaced. Just keep searching.}
{307}{}{With the way things are around here, it's best to keep your pockets shut tight. I should double-check my own gear.}
{308}{}{Captain Agatha's group had it for training, then returned it. Or so the records say.}
{309}{}{I guess I'll talk to her and her crew. Thanks.}
{310}{}{I'll handle it. But remember, you're under suspicion too.}
{311}{}{About that missing weapon...}
{312}{}{Any news?}
{313}{}{Nothing yet. No leads.}
{314}{}{What exactly went missing again?}
{315}{}{Colt 6520 pistol and ammo. Used mainly for training.}
{316}{}{Got it. I'll keep digging.}
{317}{}{Who had it last?}
{318}{}{Captain Agatha's crew. Used it for training, then returned it. Supposedly.}

{320}{}{I found the missing weapon. Captain Agatha's cadets took it along with the bullets for shooting practice.}
{321}{}{Finally! Where'd you find it?}
{322}{}{Captain Agatha's cadets swiped it for target practice.}
{323}{}{Those darn cadets... They won't get away with this. And you've earned a few of the rounds meant for those cadets. Thanks for the help.}
{324}{}{Glad to help.}
{1324}{}{Glad to help.}
{325}{}{It wasn't worth it.}
{326}{}{It was left on the shooting range. Looks like there was a mix-up in your records.}
{327}{}{Darn it. Now I'll have to report to the commander. But thanks for the assistance. I'll spread the word, might help you fit in here better.}

#Relic
{350}{}{I found something interesting. Check out this badge.}
{351}{}{Definitely not ours. Looks genuine though, a rare find.}
{352}{}{Your expression changed. How important is this to you?}
{353}{}{Insignias like these remind us of our roots, our traditions. Very important.}
{354}{}{Are you interested in buying it?}
{355}{}{Absolutely. Such things lift Ranger morale. I'll trade you some bullets for it.}
{356}{}{The badge for a round of rifle ammo? Deal.}
{357}{}{Hand over the badge. Here's the ammo.}
{358}{}{That was a good trade.}
{359}{}{I'll take revolver ammo.}
{360}{}{Badge for revolver ammo? Done.}
{361}{}{Nice trade.}
{362}{}{I need a small caliber, like a 0.22 for practice.}
{363}{}{I've got plenty. Take a whole round for the badge.}
{364}{}{Fair deal.}
{365}{}{I need some flare rounds.}
{366}{}{Badge for flare rounds? Sure thing.}
{367}{}{Excellent deal.}
{368}{}{Take it for free. I don't need it.}
{369}{}{Giving it away? Well, thank you. Won't forget this.}
{370}{}{No problem.}
{371}{}{How about some range time? I could use some practice with light weapons.}
{372}{}{Sure thing. I've got ammo and weapons just for that. Good luck at the range.}
{373}{}{Thanks...}
{374}{}{The quartermaster has reduced the cost of his goods by 10%.}
