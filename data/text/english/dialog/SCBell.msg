{100}{}{You see Officer Bell.}
{101}{}{You see a soldier with a deeply exhausted look.}
{102}{}{This patient isn't wounded or concussed. He's suffered a severe mental trauma.}
{103}{}{This should clear your head a bit, soldier...}
{104}{}{They come to me in my sleep... Don't let me fall asleep!}
{105}{}{Thank you, I feel much better now. It all seems like just a bad dream.}
{106}{}{Bell refuses to take it.}

{111}{}{Doc! Doctor! Don't let me fall asleep!}
{112}{}{Calm down, Bell. Everything's fine. Nightmares again?}
{113}{}{They come to me in my sleep... Those eyes, they look right into my soul...}
{114}{}{Who?}
{115}{}{Doc! They're going to drag me to hell!}
{116}{}{Calm down, Bell, old friend. No one will take you anywhere while you sleep. It's just a nightmare...}
{117}{}{No! They're real... Those voices in my head... I can hear them!}
{118}{}{Get a grip, soldier! There are no voices.}
{119}{}{So... it's just in my head? Sorry, Doc...}
{120}{}{Exactly, Bell. It's just a mental disorder. You need to rest.}
{121}{}{Doc, you've said that before, but the sleeping pills aren't working...}
{122}{}{I'll give you a double dose. It'll be alright.}
{123}{}{Thanks, Doc... I'll try to sleep...}
{124}{}{That's right. Sleep, Bell. No one will disturb you this time.}
{125}{}{*Snore*}
{126}{}{Phew, finally he shut up.}
{127}{}{*Z-z-z*}
{128}{}{Ah, a much-needed moment of peace...}
{129}{}{*Mumble*}

{200}{}{They come to me in my sleep... Don't let me fall asleep!}
{201}{}{Who? Who comes to you in your sleep?}
{202}{}{Them! Huge... terrifying...}
{203}{}{Listen, Bell, I want to help. Describe what you're afraid of.}
{204}{}{Soldier! Get a hold of yourself!}
{205}{}{Scary... burning eyes in the dark... I can't remember anything...}
{206}{}{It seems you've buried your memories deep in your subconscious.}
{207}{}{Stop whining like a child.}
{208}{}{It's a huge shadow. With burning eyes. It comes to me in my sleep... I can't move... It's watching... So huge...}
{209}{}{What else do you see around you? Come on, try to remember.}
{210}{}{Who is watching? Where is it looking? I don't understand!}
{211}{}{Around me, darkness... and a gray wasteland... No, it's not sand, it's ash... This is hell! I try to run, but I can't... I can't!}
{212}{}{An ashen wasteland? Where could that be?}
{213}{}{You're raving. There's no such thing as an ashen desert.}
{214}{}{I don't know! I don't know! Leave me alone!}
{215}{}{Alright, then.}
{216}{}{Fine. Your whining is getting tiresome.}

{220}{}{I want to sleep... But don't let me fall asleep! Or it will come for me... Yes, it will come and drag me straight to hell.}
{221}{}{Uh, I need to step out. Bye.}

{230}{}{Bell, look. Here's the head of that beast you fear so much.}
{231}{}{Bell, I know what you saw out there at the concrete plant. That beast is dead. The folks in Casa Nueva are already dancing around its stuffed corpse.}
{232}{}{What... That's... Ah, ha-ha! It's dead! Dead! And in daylight, it's not so scary. Phew! What a fool I've been! So much fear over some ugly mutant. Ha-ha!}
{233}{}{Yeah. It's over. It won't haunt your dreams anymore.}
{234}{}{Who would've thought.}
{235}{}{Now I remember everything. That beast appeared right in front of me during a night watch at the concrete plant. It stared into my eyes! I was a step away from death. But I was lucky, it attacked my partner instead... I guess I was so terrified that I buried that night deep in my subconscious.}
{236}{}{Anyone in your place would have been scared.}
{237}{}{That beast wouldn't have scared me.}
{238}{}{But now I'm free! Thank you, you deserve the title of Paladin far more than I do. Here, let me share some ammo with you. It's the least I can do.}
{239}{}{Take care, soldier.}
{240}{}{Yeah, you won't need those bullets. Goodbye.}
