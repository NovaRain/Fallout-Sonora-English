{100}{}{You see a Tinsmith.}
{101}{}{You see a man in dirty overalls. His bald head is shrouded in wires and sensors.}
{102}{}{You see a man wearing metal armor. Parts of the armor seem fused to his flesh.}


{110}{}{This unit requires disassembly.}
{111}{}{These components can be traded to wastelanders in Phoenix.}
{112}{}{This container of fasteners is overdue for disposal.}
{113}{}{This material serves no functional purpose.}
{114}{}{I have sympathy for this collection of scrap.}
{115}{}{Once, this heap of scrap was a marvel of engineering.}
{116}{}{Anticipating the integration of Forbidden Zone technology.}
{117}{}{A replacement for the plasma converter is required.}
{118}{}{Soon, aerial vehicles will resume their presence above us.}
{119}{}{Do you perceive the harmonious operation of the piston assembly?}

{120}{}{What directives are the Steel Gods providing?}
{121}{}{The Steel Gods have promised new schematics in exchange for micro fusion cells.}
{122}{}{These components require immediate dispatch to Steel Port.}
{123}{}{The Steel Gods aim to elevate our kind.}
{124}{}{}
{125}{}{Even the Steel Gods cannot withstand the power of atomic fission.}
{126}{}{We would never have permitted the events at Steel Port.}
{127}{}{The Steel Gods' intelligence was overestimated.}

{130}{}{When is the next consignment of uranium ore expected?}
{131}{}{The production of fusion cells is critical for the resurgence of civilization.}
{132}{}{Battery distribution must be restricted to optimize resources.}
{133}{}{Current inventory status of uranium ore?}
{134}{}{}
{135}{}{Energy conservation protocols are required until Flagstaff reactivates the mine.}
{136}{}{Fusion cell production is on hold until Flagstaff restores the mining operations.}
{137}{}{Reports indicate the Flagstaff mine is currently inactive.}
{138}{}{What is the remaining quantity of uranium ore?}
{139}{}{Without mining at Flagstaff, battery production will halt.}

{140}{}{What are the requirements from the Cathedral of Fire?}
{141}{}{The fire worshippers lack any comprehension of advanced technology.}
{142}{}{The presence of the Cathedral Ambassador impedes our operational efficiency.}
{143}{}{Instruct the Cathedral Ambassador to retract his ineffective directives.}
{144}{}{If the Cathedral insists on this, they must first secure the necessary blueprints.}
{145}{}{Despite our mockery, the Cathedral of Fire remains essential to our operations.}
{146}{}{Acquiring nuclear materials will be significantly more challenging without the Cathedral of Fire.}
{147}{}{Post-catastrophe at the Cathedral, the value of currency has drastically decreased.}
{148}{}{New alliances are imperative. The Cathedral of Fire's relevance has diminished.}
{149}{}{This is the outcome when advanced technology is mismanaged.}

{150}{}{Maintain order and avoid disruptions.}
{151}{}{Wastelanders exhibit unpredictable behavior.}
{152}{}{Our increased workload is a consequence of Master Hard's outreach.}
{153}{}{I may receive an upgrade for my systems soon.}
{154}{}{Outsiders are a necessary compromise for Progress.}
{155}{}{Our collective is free of crime; only outsiders introduce it.}
{156}{}{We are actively monitoring street activities.}
