{100}{}{You see the delegate.}
{101}{}{You see a Ranger negotiator.}
{102}{}{The ambassador was killed... by Jackals. I had nothing to do with it.}
{103}{}{Which idiot caused this massacre? All my work straight down the drain!}
{104}{}{Something happened. Now the Jackals are driving me away.}

{200}{}{Here comes our hero. I can only applaude your diplomatic skills. Very few could reach the minds of such a wild tribe. Well done! Keep it up.}

{201}{}{I'm trying. How are the negotiations going?}
{202}{}{Yes, yes?}
{203}{}{Let's talk about something else..}
{204}{}{Goodbye, Ambassador.}

{210}{}{How are negotiations going?}
{211}{}{It's hard, but the progress is noticeable. The first thing we need to do is to appease the Jackals with a small gift of provisions. Then we can start to teach them how to lead a civilized lifestyle.}
{212}{}{What do you think? Some people ruined all the plans by killing the Jackals. We can only hope that these savages don't scatter throughout Sonora and Mojave in search of new victims.}
{213}{}{Will the Jackals be useful?}
{214}{}{The Rangers can learn tactics and survival from them. They can also be used to monitor the area. This is already worth a lot. But their fundamental issues bother me - cannibalism, belief in the Spirit of the Vault, their underground lifestyle and other nonsense. It'll take a long time to change this.}
{215}{}{How do you feel about an alliance with the Jackals?}
{216}{}{Tough question. Many are unhappy with the concessions and believe that the Jackals should simply be exterminated. Because of this, the reputation of the Rangers has been tarnished a bit. But after talking with the tribe, I realized that this was not an option. Their "pack" is scattered throughout the Mojave Desert and further west. By eliminating this lair, we would have only angered the other clans. It's like throwing a stone into a river to change its course.}
{217}{}{Why did the Rangers *really* agree to this alliance?}
{218}{}{Obviously, there are other motives besides peaceful diplomacy. Jackals have been terrorizing this area for many years. There are no other ways to the north. Rangers have a special interest in the northern lands; it's a long history. Also, the tribe can become a means of putting pressure on surrounding settlements.}
{219}{}{So far I haven't even been able to meet with the leader. I think these negotiations won't get off the ground without your help.}
