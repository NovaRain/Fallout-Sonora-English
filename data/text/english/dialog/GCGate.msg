{100}{}{You see the gatekeeper.}
{101}{}{You see a heavily tanned and unshaven gate guard. His steady gaze bores right through you.}
{102}{}{Damn me! Is this motorcycle actually running?!}
{103}{}{That's a different story! Welcome to Garage City.}
{104}{}{Welcome to Garage City. Before I let you in, you'll have to answer a couple of questions.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{So, stranger, what's your business in town?}
{201}{}{I'm looking for my people. They were captured and taken in this direction.}
{202}{}{I need a place to stay for the night.}
{203}{}{Nothing. Just happened to be passing by.}

{204}{}{I don't know shit about that.}
{205}{}{So can I pass?}
{206}{}{I know for sure they were here.}
{207}{}{Maybe. You need to talk to the guys at the bar or the cartel boss.}
{208}{}{Okay. So can I pass?}
{209}{}{I told you, I don't know.}
{210}{}{I want to ask the other townsfolk. Can I come in?}

{211}{}{We have a motel, but I'm not sure if there's any rooms available.}
{212}{}{I guess I should go check it out then?}
{213}{}{A little suspicious. If you really are here by 'chance', then you shouldn't bother the townsfolk.}
{214}{}{Still, I want to look around.}

{215}{}{Are you leaving already? And rightly so... After the death of Mr. Kogan, people in the city are going a little wild.}
{216}{}{Sorry to hear that.}
{217}{}{Serves you right. There was no point in making friends with slave traders.}
{218}{}{Are you talking about the convoy from Flagstaff? Yes, the deal wasn't the best, but it brought good income to the city. I doubt these two cases are connected... Or are they?}
{219}{}{Think about it. And my business here is really already finished.}

{220}{}{Hang on! Show me your hands.}
{221}{}{Hands? What for?}
{222}{}{(raises his gun threateningly) Just show your hands!}
{223}{}{How about I show you my fists?}
{224}{}{Take it easy. I don't want to get into a fight over some little thing. But keep in mind we don't like troublemakers. So just show me your hands.}
{225}{}{Why do you need to see my hands?}
{226}{}{Okay, here.}
{227}{}{Hmm... Looks like you're okay. Come on in.}
{228}{}{What the hell was that about?}
{229}{}{Routine check. All Jackals have this sickness, and we don't need it. Shaking hands, stuttering.}
{230}{}{Sounds like the side effects of cannibalism.}
{231}{}{Hmm... you don't say... I never thought about it, but it makes sense. That's what everyone says about the Jackals. Cannibals.}
{232}{}{Well, I'll let this slide for now. Now step aside.}
{233}{}{Can you explain what that was all about?}
{234}{}{I hope this is all cleared up now. I'm going in.}
{235}{}{Well no worries then, I'm not one of these 'Jackals'.}
{236}{}{Hold it. Don't get me wrong, but before you enter the city, you've gotta show your hands.}
{237}{}{Maybe it's some natural condition?}
{238}{}{How should I know? I'm not even gonna talk to them - Just put a bullet in their head and that'll be the end of it.}

# Re-dialogue
{240}{}{Welcome to the junkyard. Make yourself at home.}
{241}{}{Welcome to Garage City. You'll love it here... once you get used to it.}
{242}{}{What, you really don't want to leave?}
{243}{}{This junkyard is our home. Our sweet cozy home.}
{244}{}{Nice piece you've got on your arm. Is that a computer? I've never seen anything like it.}
{245}{}{Hold up, who's that? Oh, it's you...}

{246}{}{Oh, you're still here. Odd, I thought you didn't like it here.}
{247}{}{Listen, folks around here are stubborn. You'd best watch yourself on the streets.}
{248}{}{Are you here for business? You'd better be, or the locals might get antsy.}
{249}{}{Listen, bother someone else. I might get in trouble for talking with you.}

{250}{}{Do you know the kid who's looking to join the Rangers?}
{251}{}{And why would I help the Rangers?}
{252}{}{This doesn't affect you.}
{253}{}{Alright. Eugene Simon is probably the one you're after. His shack is near the dorm.}
{254}{}{Thanks.}
{255}{}{It's none of your business. Just step back and stay out of the way.}
{256}{}{Oh no, everything that passes through this gate concerns me.}
{257}{}{Apologies for the gruff. It's just not usual to chat at gunpoint. So, do you allow folks in for the night?}
{258}{}{Just looking to spend the night. I won't be sticking around tomorrow.}
{259}{}{Goodbye.}

{260}{}{You mentioned some Jackals. Who are they?}
{261}{}{A tribe of savages that lives in the desert, but we don't know much about them. All we know is they're cunning sons of bitches, luring weak travelers into traps or ambushing them.}
{262}{}{I see.}
{263}{}{Why not wipe them out?}
{264}{}{We'd love to take care of them, but we don't know where they're based. Know where their main camp is?}
{265}{}{No, I don't.}
{266}{}{Figured as much.}
{267}{}{Enough talk about these Jackals.}
{268}{}{Actually, yes.}
{269}{}{Really? That changes things! Listen, we've got a couple of guys here itching to take those savages out. If you lead them to their lair, we can deal with them once and for all.}
{270}{}{I'm in. Their main camp is due north, along a dry river bed. Just follow it until you reach an old brick house. I'll wait for those guys near there.}
{271}{}{You know, I don't know those guys. I'll just go it alone.}
{272}{}{Heard the news about the Jackals?}
{273}{}{Yeah, I heard. Turns out, you're not as bad as we thought. Looks like your makin' some friends in Garage City.}
{1273}{}{Yeah, I heard. Turns out, you're not as bad as we thought. Looks like your makin' some friends in Garage City.}
{274}{}{That's good.}
{275}{}{Your reputation in Garage City has improved since dealing with the Jackal tribe.}
{276}{}{Yeah, heard about it. The Rangers have gone completely off the rails. After this, they won't be welcome any where near Garage City. Pass on that message if you cross paths with them.}
{277}{}{Alright.}
{278}{}{Hey. Nice armor, by the way.}

# Refugees
{280}{}{I hear you've got some refugees?}
{281}{}{Yeah. They've settled in an abandoned cabin in the residential area. It's across from the hydroponics hangar. But I don't think they'll stay long.}
{282}{}{Why?}
{283}{}{There's no work for them. And not everyone can make it in a place like this.}
{284}{}{Thanks. I'll look for them there.}
{285}{}{You're right - it's better not to linger in a dump like this. It's high time I was heading out too.}

# Brahmin
{287}{}{I'm ready to go after the brahmin.}
{288}{}{Great. We just gotta wait for the others...}
{289}{}{[Head to the wasteland]}
{290}{}{I hear there's a brahmin hunt planned?}
{291}{}{Yeah, there's been word of a wild brahmin spotted in the desert. Our guys are aiming to catch and carve it up. But taking down such a powerful beast won't be a cakewalk. We need folks to back us up. Interested in joining?}
{292}{}{I've heard of brahmin, but never seen one.}
{293}{}{A brahmin is... well... a large two-headed, four-legged beast. Lives in the desert, munches on grass. Got a picture now?}
{294}{}{I need a bit to get ready. Don't leave without me.}
{295}{}{Not really keen on hunting. Let's discuss something else.}
{296}{}{Count me in. When are we heading out?}
{297}{}{Once everyone's ready. Check your gear and meet back to here.}
{298}{}{Alright.}
{299}{}{Hang on, just need a bit more time. I'll be back right away.}

# Questions
{300}{}{This is my first time being so far from home. Can you tell me about this town?}
{301}{}{Can we talk about Garage City a bit?}
{302}{}{To get the gatekeeper to talk, try bringing alcohol from the local bar and offering it to him.}
{303}{}{I'd love to chat, but my throat's parched.}
{304}{}{Hang on, I'll get you something to drink.}
{305}{}{Thirsty? There must be plenty to drink around here.}
{306}{}{What do you want to know?}
{307}{}{Another question.}
{308}{}{Alright, enough chit-chat, I've got to go.}

{310}{}{How does this city survive? It doesn't seem like any crops are grown here.}
{311}{}{Survive? It's all about the ruins. Scavengers pick through them for old stuff, which the cartel then sells to caravans.}
{312}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{313}{}{No mayor or sheriff. Scavengers are organized into clans, each with its own leader. But they all answer to Mr. Kogan. He's only interested in the mine's operations, though.}
{314}{}{Tell me about Kogan.}
{315}{}{Mr. Kogan runs the scavenger cartel and deals with caravans. Let's leave it at that. The 'boss' doesn't like people talking about him.}
{316}{}{No mayor or sheriff. Scavengers split into clans. They used to answer to Mr. Kogan, but after his death, a power struggle's rocked the city.}
{317}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{318}{}{Not much to say. Came here with others hoping to make a living scavenging. Luckily, Mr. Kogan gave me a job as gatekeeper. Now I keep unwanted folks out and scare off critters.}
{319}{}{What kind of critters?}
{320}{}{Coyotes, small radscorpions, and the occasional oversized rat from the ruins. Not much for trappers here. The hunting's better in the eastern mountains, they say. Sometimes I wonder if I should head there if things get too rough in Garage City.}
{321}{}{How old are these ruins?}
{322}{}{Older than you and me put together. They date back to before the Great War, about 90 years ago. Since then, they've rusted and been buried by the sand.}
{323}{}{What was here *before* the Great War?}
{324}{}{Some place called Kingman. But who cares, really? Ancient history.}
{325}{}{Just curious. Let's talk about something else.}
{326}{}{Why do you people live amidst all this junk and ruin?}
{327}{}{Got a better idea? The old buildings fell apart, so we built new ones out of scrap.}

# About slave convoy
{330}{}{Word is there was a slave convoy that passed through here. You must know something.}
{331}{}{Don't know what you're talking about. No slave convoy came through here. Check with folks at the bar or the cartel boss. Maybe some of the scavengers know something.}
{332}{}{Please, if you know anything, tell me. It's my family and my kin that were captured. Ever lost loved ones?}
{333}{}{Alright, I'll ask around.}
{334}{}{(sighs) Didn't tell you this before, but uh, that convoy's headed for Flagstaff. Go east on Interstate 40. Takes about a week to get there, they say.}
{335}{}{Flagstaff it is. Thanks, friend. You're alright.}
{336}{}{Why the hell didn't you say so sooner?! Jose was right about this place.}
{337}{}{Sorry, can't help you.}
{338}{}{If you're lying to me, you'll regret it.}
{339}{}{Alright, I'll ask around in town.}
{340}{}{And keep in mind, the convoy is well-armed and organized. They aren't just wasteland raiders.}
{341}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{342}{}{I need to get going. Goodbye.}

{345}{}{A-ba-boo-ba-gee!}
{346}{}{Uh... (stares at you in complete confusion) Listen, I'm not sure you should go into town... They might mistake you for a Jackal. Get it? So if you decide to go in, don't say I didn't warn you.}
{347}{}{Boog.}
{348}{}{Bye.}

#Weapons
{350}{}{You've got a great rifle.}
{351}{}{Yep.}
{352}{}{Uh, let's talk about something else though.}
{353}{}{Well, that was a great chat. Goodbye.}

{354}{}{Where'd you get it?}
{355}{}{Bought it off some loser down on his luck.}
{356}{}{If it was such a good gun, he wouldn't have been down on his luck. Are you hiding something...}
{357}{}{How's the action?}
{358}{}{Like a dream. This gun's saved my hide more times than I can count.}
{359}{}{Judging by the grime, it's been a while since it's seen action.}
{360}{}{Interested in selling?}
{361}{}{Hmm... No.}
{362}{}{Your hesitation tells me something's off. It doesn't shoot, does it?}

{363}{}{Ah shit, busted! (sigh) You're spot on, it's a dud. And I can count the bullets left on one hand. What can a guy do?}
{1363}{}{Ah shit, busted! (sigh) You're spot on, it's a dud. And I can count the bullets left on one hand. Go ahead, have a good laugh.}
{364}{}{What's the point of a gun that won't fire?}
{365}{}{Intimidation, mostly! And for emergencies, I can always jab someone with the barrel. Right?}
{366}{}{No one here to fix it?}
{367}{}{Our mechanic's short on parts. Working firearms are rare here. Even if fixed, it's useless without ammo.}
{368}{}{I can fix it.}
{369}{}{Really? That'd be a lifesaver. I'll toss you 25 caps if you pull it off.}
{370}{}{I can't work on it now. I'll check it out later.}
{371}{}{Yeah, it's a dud. And bullets? I can count 'em on one hand. What can a guy do?}
{372}{}{I want to buy it.}
{373}{}{Nothing, I guess.}
{374}{}{Got it. Looks like I should mosey along.}
{375}{}{Seems like you're in a bind. I'll take off.}
{376}{}{Let's give it a whirl...}
{377}{}{Well, I'll be damned, you did it! But it's odd seeing a farmer with a firearm, huh? (chuckles) I appreciate it. Here's your 25 caps, as promised. Wish I could find more ammo...}
{378}{}{All the best, my business here's done.}
{379}{}{Actually... I don't think I can fix it.}
{380}{}{Figured as much.}
{381}{}{Can't fix it right now. Maybe later.}
{382}{}{Forget it, I won't touch your gun now.}
{383}{}{For that price, I'll toss it in the nearest trash heap. Find someone else.}

{390}{}{Hey, I thought you were meeting those guys to raid the Jackals?}
{391}{}{I changed my mind.}
{392}{}{Well, I'd watch my back if I were you. Those guys were pissed.}
{393}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Gotta go.}
{394}{}{Thanks for the warning. Can I ask you about something?}
