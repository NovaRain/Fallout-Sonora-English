{100}{}{You see Ranger Agatha.}
{101}{}{You see a battle-hardened Ranger clad in combat armor.}
{102}{}{Agatha appears preoccupied. It's best to wait a moment before addressing her.}
{103}{}{I don't want to talk to you.}
{104}{}{Agatha is ignoring your presence.}

#Cut-scene of an argument with the general:
{110}{}{This is insane!}  
{111}{}{Do you have any idea how many of our rangers the Jackals have killed, maybe even eaten?!}  
{112}{}{That scum needs to be wiped off the face of the earth!}  
{113}{}{Every. Last. One of them!}  
{114}{}{And yet... you made an alliance with them!}  
{115}{}{It's disgusting!}  
{116}{}{You can scold me all you want for breaking ranks...}  
{117}{}{But plenty of other rangers feel the same way  -  this is wrong!}  
{118}{}{An alliance won't change what those savages are...}  
{119}{}{...and it sure as hell won't bring back the dead.}  
{120}{}{I won't stand for this!}  


{200}{}{Hey! This is all on you! The Jackals have been wreaking havoc in the northern territories for years. Many brave Rangers have perished because of their treachery. I won't stand for this abominable alliance with savages. Get out of my sight!}
{201}{}{Learn to forgive. Perhaps you'll reconsider when you see the potential benefits of this alliance.}
{202}{}{Your warmongering mindset is too narrow to recognize the potential of a ceasefire. Stay blinded, lady.}
