{116}{}{This shack appears to have been deserted for ages.}
{117}{}{A long-abandoned and looted drinking hole. Someone camped here for the night.}
{118}{}{An old, dilapidated house. It's impossible to live here.}
{119}{}{The building is filled with footprints. The residents must have spent a lot of time here.}
{120}{}{The community leader's hut. The owner maintained order amidst all this destruction.}
{121}{}{Entering the club, you attract attention. The visitors eye you suspiciously before returning to their business.}

{123}{}{This library is an oasis of peace and quiet.}
{124}{}{The personal office of the Lord of Phoenix is marked by sophistication and luxury.}
