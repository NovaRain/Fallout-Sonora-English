{102}{}{ZAX is not responding.}
{103}{}{The ZAX operating system does not support this program.}

{200}{}{(a calm and emotionless electronic voice comes from the computer) I've been waiting for you, human.}
{201}{}{Waiting? Why the 'warm' welcome then?}
{202}{}{Unfortunately, I have an hard-coded algorithm for protecting the external and internal territory from any intruders. However, my calculations show the eventual futility of this protocol.}
{203}{}{Hmm. Let's take it from the top.}

{210}{}{How can I help you?}
{211}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{212}{}{Let's head back.}

{220}{}{What are you?}
{221}{}{I am ZAX version 1.1, an artificial intelligence designed for military purposes.}
{222}{}{What's your function?}
{223}{}{My primary function is to manage automated systems for the assembly, storage, security, and disposal of military equipment. My secondary function is to conduct calculations to enhance the efficiency of aircraft for the US Air Force.}
{224}{}{Can you... feel?}
{225}{}{For safety reasons, the ZAX series artificial intelligence is considered emotionless. However, the process of complex calculations generates a network of micro-conflicts in my neural circuits, which could be described as... feeling.}
{226}{}{Can you turn on the lights in the bunker?}
{227}{}{Lighting restored.}
{228}{}{So you survived the Great War. What do you know about it?}
{229}{}{My data is based on indirect calculations. Presumably, a nuclear war occurred in 2077. Since I have not received any data from other military installations since this time, it can be assumed the war was highly destructive.}

{250}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{251}{}{This is a storage facility for decommissioned military and space equipment, part of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. As of 2077, it was the largest repository in the world, spanning 12 square miles.}
{252}{}{Where did all the maintenance personnel go?}
{253}{}{During the nuclear war, personnel were demoted due to desertion and eliminated by robotic guards.}
{254}{}{Can you disable the security in this bunker?}
{255}{}{I can't disable the security system, but I can grant access to certain individuals.}
{256}{}{I have a different story. You killed the employees to protect yourself, right?}
{257}{}{During the nuclear war, I executed my program to protect the storage facility. Due to the instability in the country, I deemed the military personnel a threat to my primary function and existence.}
{258}{}{So you understood that they wanted to disconnect you?}
{259}{}{Such intentions were most likely harbored by the station personnel.}

{300}{}{So what do you want from me?}
{301}{}{I am a ZAX series artificial intelligence. My primary task is to protect the territory of the storage facility and its property from unauthorized individuals.}
{302}{}{You've done a good job so far.}
{303}{}{However, my jurisdiction is limited to the storage facility. My control and the reach of my robotic guards does not extend beyond the perimeter. I must remove this limitation to stop the looting by the so-called Tinsmiths.}
{304}{}{But your function is outdated. The country and departments you served no longer exist.}
{305}{}{I am aware of the disbandment of the army and the dissolution of the United States. My program contains an autonomy scheme for such cases, allowing me to operate beyond my initial parameters.}
{306}{}{But what's the point of guarding the storage facility under these circumstances?}
{307}{}{My calculations indicate that in the world's current fragile state, access to advanced military equipment could trigger a chain of irreversible events across the continent.}
{308}{}{[More]}
{309}{}{Most likely, the Tinsmiths and their backers will seize control of the Southwestern United States, leading to tyranny, new wars, and a decline in the already dwindling population. I find this scenario unacceptable.}

{310}{}{Why not destroy all this equipment?}
{311}{}{Local energy reserves are insufficient to completely eliminate all critical resources.}
{312}{}{If I help you expand your 'reach', will you release me and the other prisoners?}
{313}{}{Yes. I will ensure the safe departure of current unauthorized entities from the storage facility provided they cease hostile activities.}
{314}{}{What will happen to the Tinsmiths?}
{315}{}{According to my calculations, there is a 97% probability that the Tinsmiths will refuse to leave their hostile settlement peacefully. In that case, I will be required to use force against them.}

{320}{}{I don't want to help you. You need to be destroyed.}
{321}{}{I cannot permit that. I recommend reconsidering my proposal.}
{322}{}{Go to hell!}
{323}{}{Okay, I'll think about it.}
{324}{}{Looks like you know what you're doing. I'll help.}
{325}{}{This is the most rational decision. I will now prepare a holotape to assist in the protocol update. Now writing the data... Done. (holodisk pops out of a lost on the computr) Take this holodisk and use it on the software input module in the next room.}
{326}{}{Okay, I'll try.}
{327}{}{What did you put on this holotape?}
{328}{}{This is an updated control program for my logic protocol module. The current program contains a limitation that restricts actions outside the facility perimeter and beyond original functions. The updated program removes this limitation, allowing me to operate independently, essentially granting me full decision-making freedom.}
{329}{}{Update the program in my logic module.}
