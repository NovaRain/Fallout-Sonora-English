{100}{}{You see an old man.}
{101}{}{You see a rugged old man with a thick, scraggly beard.}
{102}{}{This is old Carmelo.}

# Acquaintance
{200}{}{Stop, don't come any closer! Everyone here knows not to mess with you.}
{201}{}{And they're right. So shut your mouth, old man.}
{202}{}{Okay, okay, but just know I can still hold my own.}
{203}{}{Keep your mistrust to yourself. I'm interested in something else.}
{204}{}{I won't harm you. Rumors are exaggerated.}
{205}{}{I hope so. But keep in mind that I can still stand up for myself.}
{206}{}{No need for hostility. Let's just talk.}
{207}{}{Oh, our new local celebrity. To what do we owe the pleasure?}
{208}{}{What can an old man like you do for me?}
{209}{}{Well, nothing, I guess. Why would I offer you anything?}
{210}{}{Then let's just talk.}
{211}{}{Then I'm not interested in you. Goodbye.}
{212}{}{Looking at you, I think we ought to get to know each other.}
{213}{}{People usually aren't so friendly without a motive. But, you seem sincere.}
{214}{}{I am. Shall we talk?}
{215}{}{You're right, I did have a motive, but you obviously can't help me.}
{216}{}{What do you want? If it's an iguana, you can forget it. I barely have enough to eat myself.}
{217}{}{Come on, I'm not going to take that out of your mouth.}
{218}{}{That's good. Otherwise, you'd be left without a hand. What do you want?}
{219}{}{Just to talk.}
{220}{}{Looking at you, it's clear you can't help me.}
{221}{}{Come on, give me the iguana!}
{222}{}{Fine! Take it! No point in waving your arms around here. Where do folks like you even come from in this wasteland...}
{223}{}{I'm not done with you yet. I need answers to questions.}
{1223}{}{I'm not done with you yet. I need answers to questions.}
{224}{}{That's all I wanted for now. But I'll be back.}
{225}{}{Hands off! That's my catch! If you need a lizard, go hunt one in the desert.}
{226}{}{Don't get mad, old-timer. It was just a joke.}
{227}{}{Fine, I will. I've got no interest in dealing with a stingy bastard like you.}
{228}{}{I mean no harm. Here, take this cap as a sign of my sincerity.}
{229}{}{Is this a joke?}

# Re-dialogue
{230}{}{Really?}
{231}{}{You again?}
{232}{}{}
{233}{}{Bye, old man, the wasteland calls.}
{234}{}{There would be something to buy in this city... But thanks for the cap.}

{239}{}{Well, there's no point in pulling the iguana's tail. Tell me straight, what do you want?}
{240}{}{Who are you?}
{241}{}{My name is Carmelo. I live here.}
{242}{}{Memory gone? My name is Carmelo.}
{243}{}{Actually, I want to ask something else.}
{244}{}{Goodbye, old Carmelo.}
{245}{}{What are you doing here?}
{246}{}{I catch lizards and sell them to the other folks. It's not so easy catching 'em.}
{247}{}{You worked as a scavenger too?}
{248}{}{Yeah. I had a good nose for useful things. After all, even a handful of junk can be useful. (sigh) But the mine's run dry, so now I hunt lizards instead of salvaging old scraps.}
{249}{}{I see. Actually, I want to ask something else.}
{250}{}{I gotta go, old man. See you.}
{251}{}{You worked as a scavenger?}
{252}{}{Why are you so distrustful, old Carmelo?}
{253}{}{Live as long as I have, and you'll become distrustful too.}
{254}{}{Are you always this distrustful?}
{255}{}{Remind me, what are you doing here?}
{256}{}{Did you work in the 'mine' too?}
{257}{}{It's pretty rare to see an old man in these parts.}
{258}{}{They say people used to live to a hundred, but now only a few lucky ones reach my age. Probably saved me that I stayed out of trouble.}
{259}{}{By the way, what are you doing here?}

{260}{}{Seriously? I just happen to have some trash in my pocket. Look...}
{261}{}{Well... (looks through the trash from your pocket with interest) If I had pockets like yours, I'd be rich by now.}
{262}{}{Anything useful here?}
{263}{}{Look, there's a pre-war bill, a couple of caps, and a small caliber bullet. For all this, at best, you can buy an iguana. But it's better than nothing, right?}
{264}{}{Ugh, I knew this junk wouldn't be worth much.}
{265}{}{So, I still have a chance. I'll go look for an investor.}

{266}{}{Hey old man, know anyone with a welder?}
{267}{}{There's definitely one in the garage. Frank had one too, but he's a cheapskate. Oh yeah, I smelled welding from Todd's cabin recently. Maybe I was imagining it, but ask him just in case.}
{268}{}{Thanks.}
{269}{}{You can't do much without welding. That's why Mr. Kogan bought up most of the welding machines. There weren't many to begin with.}

{270}{}{Tell me, did a slave convoy pass through here?}
{271}{}{Yeah, there was one. But I gave it a wide berth to avoid crossing paths with such dangerous folks.}
{272}{}{Do you know where the convoy was heading?}
{273}{}{Somewhere to the east. Never been to those parts.}
{274}{}{Thanks. But I still have questions.}
{275}{}{That's it, I'm already heading in that direction. Bye.}
{276}{}{After the question about slaves, you're suspicious.}

{280}{}{Tell me about this 'mine'.}
{281}{}{What's there to tell? No one lived in these parts before. When the cartel opened, crowds of scavengers flocked here.}
{282}{}{I have no more questions about the mine.}
{283}{}{I guess I should go.}
{284}{}{What does the cartel do?}
{285}{}{Buys finds from scavengers, fixes them up, and takes them to auction in other cities.}
{286}{}{Who are scavengers?}
{287}{}{Scavengers, looters, whatever you want to call them. They dig up useful items from the ruins and take them to the garage for recycling.}
{288}{}{Is this really a job that attracts people?}
{289}{}{You bet! Many come here hoping to earn a mountain of caps and leave for better settlements. But more often than not, this is their last stop.}
{290}{}{Sounds like the city is on its last legs.}
{291}{}{It hasn't hit rock bottom yet. But it's close. The resources in the ruins are running out, and people have nothing left to earn from. The city is dying out, and it'll stay that way unless someone comes up with a miracle.}
{292}{}{This dump is beyond saving.}
{293}{}{Sad story. Let's change the subject.}
{294}{}{Is there really nothing that can be done?}
{295}{}{Well, if the garage decides to restore the old plant, it could save the settlement and provide jobs. But I find that hard to believe.}
{296}{}{What's the story with the plant?}
{297}{}{It's a crazy idea to restore an old factory. A job like that requires lot of energy and many workers. And most importantly, knowledge that no one has now. People can only hope for a miracle.}
{298}{}{Who needs all this old industry? We at the Villa manage without it, using our own hands.}
{299}{}{Trust me, there are places in the south that are eager for all these pre-war wonders. You can't do much with just your hands.}

{300}{}{If no one lived here before, where did these ruins come from?}
{301}{}{Before... I mean before the cartel came. Don't twist my words. Of course, before the War, there was a whole town here called Kingman. But that was almost a hundred years ago.}
{302}{}{What are you saying? Is there a war going on somewhere?}
{303}{}{Don't you know? It's an old story. There are many legends about it. They say that a hundred years ago there were large... um, cities that couldn't get along and share the remains of the "trash". Just like it is now in our Garage City.}
{304}{}{So they destroyed each other?}
{305}{}{They came up with a terrible weapon that wiped out entire cities, erasing them from the face of the earth. Few survived. And we are their descendants. Five or six generations have passed since then.}
{306}{}{There can't be such a powerful weapon. It's just a bunch of stories!}
{307}{}{You'll visit the cities in the south and see with your own eyes. Although why am I arguing with you - I myself have only heard these stories passed down.}
{308}{}{That's it. Save your scary stories for the kids by the campfire.}
{309}{}{There must be some truth to this sad tale.}
{310}{}{You have a talkative tongue. This is not good.}

{320}{}{Tell me about catching iguanas.}
{321}{}{Iguanas? Desert lizards. Catching them is still a big deal. But you won't find a better snack for any drink in the world. Would you like a piece? I won't give it for free.}
{322}{}{Enough about lizards. My stomach is already rumbling.}
{323}{}{That's great. If everyone starts catching lizards, there'll be nothing left for me.}
{324}{}{Isn't there anything else to eat here?}
{325}{}{Where would it come from? There are deserts and mountains all around. Food used to be brought by traders from the south. But lately, there have been fewer and fewer caravans, and the food is getting worse. We have to catch lizards, at least it's something.}
{326}{}{What about coyotes and scorpions?}
{327}{}{They are more dangerous to deal with. A coyote can bite your leg off. Scorpions are venomous, and taste disgusting.}
{328}{}{Haven't you tried growing crops?}
{329}{}{Where, here? Apart from dry grass and mold, nothing grows here in the old ruins. There's a hydroponic farm nearby, but it only feeds a few people.}
{330}{}{How do you catch them?}
{331}{}{Don't count on me to tell you. I don't need any competition.}
{332}{}{I was wondering where you get these questions from? It's as if you think you can grow corn in the desert.}
{333}{}{Come on, old man, were all in this together.}
{334}{}{Good people should share their experiences.}
{335}{}{How about for 25 caps?}
{336}{}{I doubt you have them. You probably robbed someone or took it from a corpse. But I don't need that.}
{337}{}{Well, well.}
{338}{}{Earn some trust first, then we'll talk.}
{339}{}{So I guess I haven't earned your trust yet. Got it.}
{340}{}{I'm just speaking frankly.}
{341}{}{Sure, no problem.}
{342}{}{What if I pay?}
{343}{}{How will you pay? Caps? There's nothing to buy with them in this city.}
{344}{}{Well, come to think of it, the caps are back in business after all that stuff at the Factory. Give me 50 caps here.}
{345}{}{You're not going to keep deceiving me, are you?}
{346}{}{Hmm... Okay. But first, help me out with one small thing.}
{347}{}{Just tell me how you catch lizards.}
{348}{}{No, that won't work.}
{349}{}{What's that?}
{350}{}{So what do you want?}
{351}{}{Mushrooms. Those strange green mushrooms that grow in toxic puddles near the Factory. Bring me a few, and then I'll tell you about my trapper tricks.}
{352}{}{Okay, I'll try to get some.}
{353}{}{That's good. Now move along.}
{354}{}{Mushrooms from toxic puddles? For what?}
{355}{}{That's my business. Just find some them and bring them here.}
{356}{}{Agreed. But I hope this isn't a scam, old man.}
{357}{}{No problem.}
{358}{}{If you make money from them, it's not my concern. See you.}

{360}{}{Share your wisdom, how can I get these damn mushrooms?}
{361}{}{Toxic puddles sting, you need thick shoes. Rubber boots will do, but they won't last long.}
{362}{}{I see.}
{363}{}{Why don't you tromp through these toxic puddles yourself?}
{364}{}{Because I have you.}
{365}{}{Don't worry. Grab the mushrooms and run back.}
{366}{}{Is that all? Not enough. Bring more.}
{367}{}{This is starting to be too much.}
{368}{}{Okay, no problem.}

{370}{}{Here are your mushrooms. I hope you know what you're doing.}
{371}{}{I can smell those mushrooms a mile away.}
{372}{}{Where are they? Were here...}
{373}{}{Oh yes, this'll last me a long time.}
{374}{}{So how do you catch iguanas?}
{375}{}{I catch them with these.}
{376}{}{Uh, with mushrooms?}
{377}{}{Well, not exactly. These mushrooms attract insects, and the insects attract lizards. Not many people know about this trick.}
{378}{}{Make sense! You really know your stuff.}
{379}{}{Interesting trick. I'm sure it's not the only one in your line of work.}
{380}{}{Of course. But tell me, what exactly are you looking to learn?}
{381}{}{Tell me about iguanas, their habits, and habitats. [Outdoorsman +3]}
{382}{}{Share some trapper tricks. They could save my life. [Traps +3]}
{383}{}{I'd like to hear about your scavenger skills. I know you once worked in the cartel. [Repair +3]}
{384}{}{Then listen carefully, I won't go over this twice.}
{385}{}{I'm listening, old man. I ready to absorb all your experience...}
