{210}{}{Cancel alarm.}
{211}{}{Alarm disabled.}
{212}{}{Disable the traps in the hallway.}
{213}{}{Traps have been deactivated.}

{220}{}{Sabotage in Flagstaff}
{221}{}{(Flagstaff agents report sabotage in a uranium mine. The saboteurs are presumably prisoners. We should reconsider our policy regarding this colony and Mr. Faber's methods.)}

{230}{}{Old report on the Phoenix coup}
{231}{}{(The Advisor details the Phoenix coup from several years ago. Records indicate a third force installed the Fire Cult's power in the city, placing its own people in control. The unnamed organization's goals are to form a society for creating raw materials, a reconstruction base, and to supply headquarters with basic resources. Essentially, the Cult of Fire is a puppet in someone else's game.)}
{232}{}{Financial report}
{233}{}{Thanks to our systematic efforts, a new bottle cap currency, borrowed from the Hub, has firmly established itself in Phoenix. Since the residents were unaccustomed to currency, it took years to instill this concept and stabilize the cap's exchange rate. Attached are statistics and analysis of financial processes in the city, along with future prospects for the cap currency.}

{240}{}{Cult status report}
{241}{}{...Conclusion 1: As expected, the Cult of Fire, modeled after the Children of the Cathedral, has shown good results. It controls almost all aspects of life in the city and has solidified its position. The population of Phoenix is either loyal to the fire worshippers or fears them. Thus, we can flexibly manipulate local society with the Followers of Fire. While rebels in the sewers still cause problems, they pose no significant threat to our plan.}
{242}{}{Read more}
{243}{}{Conclusion 2: We remain incognito, limited to a small circle of selected individuals. The cult leader is ready to follow our instructions unquestioningly, despite his ambitions. He is aware of his puppet status and accepts it but is unaware of our ultimate plans. This relationship is expected to continue for the next 3-4 years, after which it may be beneficial to replace Aaron.}
{244}{}{Read more}
{245}{}{Conclusion 3: I believe the cult is ready to expand. We will begin spreading the ideas of the Holy Fire into San Brahmin to establish a new raw materials and transport colony there.}

{250}{}{GECK search report}
{251}{}{Information on the operational Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK) is still missing; the search continues. Expedition reports are attached.}
{252}{}{Expedition to Vault 26}
{253}{}{The expedition to Vault 26 returned negative results. The vault was destroyed by a nuclear strike, making excavation impossible.}
{254}{}{Expedition to Vault 27}
{255}{}{The Vault 27 expedition could not confirm the presence of the GECK. Long-term excavations are ongoing. The vault was confirmed to be looted and in poor condition. Some equipment was transported to Two-Sun; the list is attached along with copies of the expedition reports.}
{256}{}{Note}
{257}{}{It is reported that Phoenix's population largely descends from Vault 27 inhabitants. There is also a legend about their ancestors' discord, leading them to go separate ways. It's hypothesized that one group took the GECK with them. This hypothesis must be pursued if the device is not found.}
{258}{}{Search coordinates for Vault 27}
{259}{}{(You enter the coordinates into your Pip-Boy.)}

{260}{}{Report on the nuclear bomb project}
{261}{}{The project is currently 92% complete. We are awaiting new mechanical components from the Two-Sun workshops. Progress is hampered by a lack of scientific personnel and slow uranium production in the Flagstaff mine. Fire worshippers remain unaware of the true customer and purpose of the bomb.}
