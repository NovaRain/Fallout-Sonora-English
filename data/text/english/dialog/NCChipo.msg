# Dialogue
{210}{}{What are you up to?}
{211}{}{Wow. I thought you were run out of town.}
{212}{}{Hey, you're the one that's being talked about so much, aren't you? Cool.}
{213}{}{Pinky's been pretty lively lately. Seems he's all better.}
{214}{}{Hey, keep an eye on Pinkie okay?}

{219}{}{Bye, Chip.}

{220}{}{Do you know where your dad is?}
{221}{}{In the office, probably. As usual. He constantly sits there over his papers, and he kicks me out so I don't bother him.}
{222}{}{Trust me, you really shouldn't "bother" him.}

{230}{}{You have an unusual pet.}
{231}{}{This is Pinky. He's cool, but people don't want him in town.}
{232}{}{Why?}
{233}{}{They come up with all sorts of things. Saying he's dangerous, spreads infection, or harms plantations. Nonsense. Frank's the most unhappy about it. He keeps threatening to kill Pinky whenever he can.}
{234}{}{Pig rats can indeed be dangerous.}
{235}{}{But Pinky's not like that! He hasn't done anything wrong. He just scratches at night. Lately, he's been sick too. While everyone wants him dead, he really needs help now.}
{236}{}{Maybe it's for the best. Bye.}
{237}{}{That's unfortunate. Hang in there, buddy.}
{238}{}{Let me take a look at this creature. Maybe I can help him heal.}
{239}{}{I had to perform a whole operation on Pinkie. But it's all over now.}
{240}{}{You mean you fixed him! Amazing! Oh, thank you so much. You know, he seems to like you. You can play with him if you want. But don't go too far from the plantations, or he might wander into the desert.}
{241}{}{Glad to help. Have fun with your little firend, Chipo.}
{1241}{}{Glad to help. Have fun with your little firend, Chipo.}
{242}{}{That's not fair.}
{243}{}{I'd like to take Pinkie for a walk.}
{244}{}{If he wants to go with you, then I don't mind. Just don't take him too far from home.}
{245}{}{Thanks. I'll take a walk around the town with him.}
