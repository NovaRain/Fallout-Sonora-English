{102}{}{Well, what else?}
{103}{}{I'll kill every Brotherhood of Steel scum I can find!}
{104}{}{I hate the Brotherhood! Hate them!}

{110}{}{Hey, Brotherhood mutt, drop your gun and come out!}
{111}{}{I won't touch you. Just want to talk.}
{112}{}{Say everything that's been building up.}
{113}{}{Do you know how many of ours they've killed in Lost Hills?}
{114}{}{You took our home. You took our god.}
{115}{}{Do you think we can get along after this?}
{116}{}{Oh, I'm SO angry. But I'll be kind to you - I'll kill you quickly. You won't feel a thing.}
{117}{}{Agreed?}
{118}{}{Why do you suffer? Why resist? I'll free you from this torment.}
{119}{}{God was on our side. And behind you - generals. Pitiful humans, how you've fallen!}

{200}{}{Hey, dead meat, be careful. There's some Brotherhood of Steel fiend lurking around here. Watch out, don't get caught in their crossfire.}
{201}{}{Ah, I see. I'll hurry away before it gets too hot around here.}
{202}{}{Don't you dare pursue Brotherhood folks! I won't allow it!}
{203}{}{Hey, I just saw him run towards the piers! While you were talking to thin air, he's long gone.}
{204}{}{What the... Ugh, I'll catch him now! You won't get away!}
{205}{}{Hurry up, big guy!}
{206}{}{Ha-ha, you're such an idiot! It was easier to trick you than a child! What's got you all riled up, dummy?}
{207}{}{Gomer? And you're here? Hey, did you enslave a human? Well done. Meanwhile, I'm trying to flush out a Brotherhood mutt hiding in the cafe. Will you help me deal with him?}
{208}{}{Gomer, let's get out of here? This isn't our business.}
{209}{}{Gomer, tell this dimwit that the war is over. Stop fighting. Leave the human alone.}
{210}{}{Gomer and the human are partners now? I haven't heard about that. Maybe it's really time for peace? Alright, Gomer, I'll trust you.}
{211}{}{Alright then. Go your way.}
{212}{}{Ahh! Die, you stupid humans!}
{213}{}{Not before you, you stinker!}
{214}{}{Wait, let's talk!}
{215}{}{Hold on! There's no need for us to fight. I don't want to harm you.}
{216}{}{I'll never forgive what humans did to us!}
{217}{}{It's a shame you can't see it the right way...}
{218}{}{You're wasting your time...}
{219}{}{The ghouls will be unhappy with you. They're building a city for everyone in Brighttown. Humans and mutants can live together in Dayglow. Don't you want long-awaited peace?}
{220}{}{Ghouls are naive! One day they'll pay for it. Humans will betray them!}
{221}{}{You better protect them. Don't let humans manipulate ghouls. There will always be more humans. One battle won't fix everything.}
{222}{}{You make a good point. I hadn't thought about that. Should I go to town? Offer myself as a guard for the ghouls? Yeah, that's a good idea! I won't let anyone harm the ghouls, no way!}
{223}{}{That's good. See? There's always room for agreement.}
{224}{}{I have to agree with you on that. So, shall we continue fighting, dummy?}
