{100}{}{You see John D. Butler.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in a worn-out business suit.}
{102}{}{Are you heading to the naval base? Private Gomer wants to go too!}

#Introduction
{200}{}{Hey there. Looks like we haven't met before. I'm John Butler, elected mayor of Dayglow. And who might you be?}
{201}{}{Nice to meet you, Butler. I am }
{202}{}{, just another poor soul mutated by the wasteland.}
{203}{}{Don't try to cozy up to me, ghoul.}
{204}{}{(sigh) Never thought I'd see one mutant accuse another of being a mutant.}
{205}{}{The wasteland sure throws all kinds at you.}
{206}{}{*Attention!* I am John Butler. I run this town... or what's left of it. And I welcome any smoothskin who behaves in my town. *Fire! Fire!*}
{207}{}{I have no intention of causing trouble here.}
{208}{}{Humans and super mutants kicked us out of our homes. I'm sure you've heard the story. But that's no reason to hate everyone. On the contrary, I want to prove to people that ghouls are just as human as they are... *Keep firing!*}
{209}{}{Are you trying to trick me? I thought ghouls hated normies.}
{210}{}{We moved here because humans and super mutants drove us from our homes. But that's no reason to hate everyone. On the contrary, I want to prove to people that ghouls are human too... *Keep firing!*}
{211}{}{Wordplay isn't your strong suit, John.}
{212}{}{You're right. This soldier's got no humor. Old habits die hard, even after a hundred years. So, how can I help you?}
{213}{}{Nothing for now, thanks.}
{214}{}{That's very noble of you.}
{215}{}{To hell with us old folks. We've survived many wars and battles, our fate is in the past. What matters is what happens to your generation... *Charge! Forward!* So, how can I help you?}
{216}{}{I just wanted to say hello. But now I must be going.}
{1216}{}{I just wanted to say hello. But now I must be going.}

{220}{}{Well, well, if it isn't our old pal, Gomer. And he's brought a human? That's newsworthy! Like a snake making friends with a rabbit. I'm really happy for you.}
{1220}{}{Well, well, if it isn't our old pal, Gomer. And he's brought a human? That's newsworthy! Like a snake making friends with a rabbit. I'm really happy for you. Too bad we don't have a church to get you two married.}
{221}{}{Gomer is my bodyguard.}
{222}{}{I command Gomer. He can't even take a leak without my order.}

#Repeat Dialogue
{230}{}{Alright. How can I help you?}
{231}{}{Hello, smoothskin. Got a question?}
{1231}{}{Hello, smoothskin. Got a question?}
{232}{}{Hello, young wasteland mutant. How can I help you?}
{233}{}{Hey, John. Just passing through. See you.}
{234}{}{Shame we didn't chat longer. If you need anything - I'm always here... *Death! De-eath!*}
{235}{}{Goodbye.}
{236}{}{What do you need?}
{237}{}{Enough joking around. Time to get to business.}

{240}{}{Tell me, how did you all end up here?}
{241}{}{We lived up north, in a city called Necropolis. Then the super mutants came. And after them, the normies. They fought each other and forgot about us... *Aim! Fire!* When the dust settled, the normies decided they didn't like ghouls either. So we decided to find a new home.}
{242}{}{What kind of city are you trying to build?}
{243}{}{Just a normal, functioning city. With trade and economy, hotels and casinos, roads and skyscrapers. And enough room for everyone - ghouls, humans, and mutants alike. *At ease, soldiers!*}
{244}{}{Thanks for the info. I need to be going.}
{245}{}{Can I help with anything?}
{246}{}{Do you really want to help? If it weren't for these glazed eyes, I'd be in tears right now. Ask the corpses around here, I'm sure someone needs help.}
{247}{}{Will do. Goodbye.}
{248}{}{Can I help with anything else?}
{249}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{250}{}{I've already told you. I'm John Butler. I'm the mayor of Dayglow... well, the future Dayglow.}
{251}{}{Does San Ysidro fall under your control?}
{252}{}{It's one of the districts of future Dayglow. There are several ghoul camps in the ruins. Old Town and San Ysidro are the largest. Each is managed by its own administrator. *God bless America!*}

#Story Quests
{259}{}{Urgent! There's a reason you had to fix the radio station. A caravan from the Far Go Traders just contacted us. The guys got ambushed on Route Five. Ghouls are too slow and weak. Our hope lies with you. Go, help your fellow kin in their time of need. *March!*}
{260}{}{I'm already on my way!}
{261}{}{As usual, you're of no help. Fine, I'll take care of it.}
{262}{}{The caravan is at the highway junction. Head straight north on the main road.}
{263}{}{Are the Far Go Traders still alive?}
{264}{}{I haven't had a chance to check on them. I'll be back when I know more.}
{265}{}{Mr. Rutger told me about your heroic deed. Saving the caravan benefits us ghouls greatly. We need goods from the north, and the Far Go Traders are the most reliable caravan company. So thank you}
{266}{}{.}
{267}{}{, smoothskin.}
{268}{}{No problem.}
{269}{}{I can see by your eyes that your mission failed. Well, Rutger was the best caravaner. Without him and his company, trading with humans will be harder. But Gustavo will be pleased to hear this. He doesn't want to share Old World finds with smoothskins.}
{270}{}{That was the plan all along.}
{271}{}{It's a shame it ended that way. But I did my best.}
{1271}{}{It's a shame it ended that way. But I did my best.}
{272}{}{Now I need to check and ponder some things. You can rest for a while.}
{273}{}{Alright.}
{274}{}{}
{275}{}{}

#Story Quests
{300}{}{Gustavo asked me to give you this disk.}
{301}{}{Hand it over. Let's see what this old stiff is up to... Hmm. These are killer updates! Now Dayglow has power and radio communication. Just like in the good old days. What could be better? *Everyone to the front! To war!*}
{302}{}{[Continue]}
{303}{}{Ah yes, Gustavo is again demanding we cut ties with the smoothskins. The old geezer doesn't get it. *Aim! Fire!* You see, Gustavo wants to shield the city from outsiders. I think that's foolish. We need goods and supplies from the Hub. And the Hub needs Dayglow's technology. Tell me, you're not planning to indulge his nonsense, are you?}
{304}{}{No, I'm not.}
{305}{}{I don't care who pays for the job.}
{306}{}{Great. Then I have a couple of small and easy tasks for you.}
{307}{}{I'm listening.}
{308}{}{What if I am?}
{309}{}{That would be sad. And very foolish.}
{310}{}{Not convinced. I'm heading back to San Ysidro.}
{311}{}{Alright. You convinced me. What do you need done?}
{312}{}{That would be sad. And very foolish. Tell me, do you care who pays for the job? I need your services too.}
{313}{}{What do you need done?}

{320}{}{Right now, the scavengers are tearing apart the old aircraft factory, piece by piece. I don't mind that it's those smooth-skins doing it, but they're working without Set's Seal and even forcing ghouls into labor. Most importantly, we need the electronics from that factory for the next caravan. Get to it! Head over to the Factory. Tell the scavengers I'll give them Set's Seal if they get all the chips. And not a word to Gustavo!}
{321}{}{What is "Set's Seal"?}
{322}{}{It's the right to scavenge for resources in San Diego and its surroundings. Naturally, in exchange for a share of the profits. A kind of tax. *Never surrender!* If the scavengers take all the resources for themselves, our city will be left with nothing.}
{323}{}{Got it. I'll try to talk to them.}
{324}{}{We need to discuss the situation with the scavengers at the Factory.}
{325}{}{So, did you complete the collection plan?}
{326}{}{No, unfortunately.}
{327}{}{I just want to ask again, what is "Set's Seal"?}
{328}{}{Ah, now I understand.}
{329}{}{It turns out that all the scavengers at the factory are dead.}
{330}{}{All dead? Holy saints! What about the chips? Did you manage to collect them?}
{331}{}{Always glad to help.}
{332}{}{What's in it for me for all my effort?}
{333}{}{We collected all the chips and sent them here.}
{334}{}{Excellent work. *Take no prisoners!*}
{335}{}{Here's your reward. But don't rush off to the bar. We've got a problem here.}
{336}{}{Thanks. What happened?}
{337}{}{No. Should there be?}
{338}{}{The chips were the main point! Since the scavengers didn't succeed, you're our last hope. Bring those damn chips.}
{339}{}{Alright.}
{340}{}{Yes. Here they are.}
{341}{}{Only part of them.}
{342}{}{The chips were the main point! Since the scavengers didn't succeed, you're our last hope. Collect the remaining chips.}
{343}{}{The Factory is now under Gustavo's control. You won't be getting any chips.}
{344}{}{What, Gustavo beat me to it? That's killer news! But right now we have a bigger problem. We'll have to put this argument aside.}
{345}{}{What happened?}
{346}{}{Where is the aircraft factory located?}
{347}{}{Get to Highway 805. Find the Paradise Valley Hospital there. The Factory will be to the east.}
{348}{}{Got it.}
{349}{}{}

{350}{}{So, I've thought it through and made a decision! You see, Mr. Rutger was carrying a valuable contract from the Hub for a technology exchange with the Coronado naval base. This is a HUGE profit for the city. We can restore the ruins. The dream of Dayglow will be fulfilled! *Viva, America!*}
{351}{}{From a naval base? Seriously?}
{352}{}{It's inaccessible right now due to old military defenses. Here are the access codes. They need to be transmitted via the radio station you repaired in San Ysidro. We have no other powerful signal source. Once you've done that, come to the pier; an escort will be waiting. And don't mention this to Gustavo!}
{353}{}{[Leave]}
