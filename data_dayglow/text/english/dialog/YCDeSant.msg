{100}{}{You see Mr. De Santi.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in a pre-war suit and fedora. A long scar runs across his face.}
{102}{}{This is Albert De Santi.}

{200}{}{You've come to the right place, kid. I'm Albert De Santi. This is my establishment-the La Pensione Hotel and Spa.}
{1200}{}{You're in the right place, honey. I'm Albert De Santi. This is my establishment-the La Pensione Hotel and Spa.}
{201}{}{[Continue]}
{202}{}{Here, you can forget about the harsh reality. Massage, retro cinema, sterile baths, radiation tanning, exquisite rat dishes, custom orders for any whim-just tell me what you want.}
{203}{}{Seriously? You opened a spa in the middle of these burned-out ruins? Who would come here?}
{204}{}{Relax, kid. It's actually safest in a place like this... Well, except for those lunatics across the street. They're still tolerating ghouls, but it's only a matter of time.}
{1204}{}{Relax, honey. It's actually safest in a place like this... Well, except for those lunatics across the street. They're still tolerating ghouls, but it's only a matter of time.}
{205}{}{Alright. I'll keep that in mind.}

{210}{}{What's on your mind, kid?}
{1210}{}{What's on your mind, honey?}
{211}{}{Nothing. See you around.}
{212}{}{See you around, Mr. De Santi.}
{213}{}{Catch you later, Mr. De Santi.}
{214}{}{Ah, love the smell of caps before bed. Alright, kid, you really earned half.}
{215}{}{(shakes the bag of caps) Ah! Love the sound of caps during lunch. Alright, kid, you really earned half.}

# Quests
{220}{}{Have you tried dealing with the crazies in the building next door?}
{221}{}{I'll pay 100 hubbucks for each one. Do it, and the money is yours.}
{222}{}{Don't you feel bad for them? They're your kin after all.}
{223}{}{Keep this in mind, kid: in this business, you need to know one thing-shoot first, shoot yourself, shoot always. And you'll survive.}
{1223}{}{Honey, in this business, you need to know one thing-shoot first, shoot yourself, shoot always. And you'll survive.}
{224}{}{Deal. I'm looking for a way to earn anyway. Consider it done.}
{225}{}{No. I won't do it.}
{226}{}{All the crazies have been taken care of.}
{227}{}{Here you go, kid. Easy money. You just stood by.}
{1227}{}{Here you go, honey. Easy money. You just stood by.}
{228}{}{I like your business approach, mister. I can keep working for you. Maybe there's someone else you need dealt with?}
{229}{}{There's another problem. You know Derrick? He's dealing right at the entrance, cutting into my profits. I don't like it! Do something about him.}
{230}{}{Okay.}
{231}{}{Derrick won't bother you anymore. He's filled with lead.}
{232}{}{What a pity! Of course, you don't know who did it, right? (winks and hands you 100 caps) I'll have to clean up the mess at the entrance.}
{233}{}{[Leave]}
{234}{}{Derrick has reconsidered his future plans. He's ready to work for you.}
{235}{}{Great job, kid. This deserves extra pay. (winks and hands you 150 caps)}
{1235}{}{Great job, honey. This deserves extra pay. (winks and hands you 150 caps)}
{236}{}{[Leave]}
{237}{}{Are you sure killing the crazies is a good idea?}
{238}{}{Fine, suit yourself.}
{239}{}{Remind me, why does Derrick bother you?}
{240}{}{He's dealing right at the entrance, cutting into my profits. I don't like it! Do something about him.}
{241}{}{Okay.}
{242}{}{Is there more work?}
{243}{}{One worthless scumbag fled to Old Town without paying me the caps owed for services.}
{244}{}{What's the name of this scumbag?}
{245}{}{His name is Kurt. He owes me 300 caps. Shake them out of him, and you get half.}
{246}{}{Alright.}
{247}{}{Here are the caps Kurt owed-exactly 300 of them.}
{248}{}{Ah, love the smell of caps in the morning. Alright, kid, you really earned half.}
{249}{}{Of course.}

{250}{}{It looks like everything is falling apart here. Need a worker?}
{251}{}{You're right. Handling this alone is tough. I really need a housekeeper.}
{252}{}{I can work for a moderate fee.}
{253}{}{Sorry, but I can't help with that.}
{254}{}{There's a better candidate. He doesn't even need to be paid. He's in the pantry across the street. His name is Mr. Handy. All it takes is to get him up and running and set him up with an administrator program. I'll pay you 300 hubbucks for this easy job.}
{255}{}{Alright, I'll do it.}
{256}{}{Then get to work, kid. You can find parts anywhere, but I'd look for the program in Old Town.}
{1256}{}{Then get to work, honey. You can find parts anywhere, but I'd look for the program in Old Town.}
{257}{}{Okay.}
{258}{}{I got the robot up and running. But where can I find a program for him?}
{259}{}{The administrator program. I'd start looking in Old Town.}
{260}{}{I think the administrator position is now filled.}
{261}{}{Great job, kid. Here's your reward. By the way, I have more tasks for you.}
{1261}{}{Great job, honey. Here's your reward. By the way, I have more tasks for you.}
{262}{}{What are they?}
{263}{}{Got it.}
{264}{}{Not interested. I don't want to fix old tech.}
{265}{}{One of the clients ordered an old cult movie, "Deep Throat." What, you haven't heard of it? Such a shame! Anyway, someone in San Ysidro has it. Get it for me, and I'll share the money.}
{1265}{}{One of the clients ordered an old cult movie, "Deep Throat." What, you haven't heard of it? Such a shame! Anyway, someone in San Ysidro has it. Get it for me, and I'll share the money.}
{266}{}{Alright.}
{267}{}{Where did you say I can find that movie?}
{268}{}{Someone among the ghouls in San Ysidro has it. I'm not sure exactly who.}
{269}{}{Got it.}
{270}{}{Here's the movie you were looking for.}
{271}{}{I love old classics. But I wouldn't recommend watching it. You're too young for this, kid. Just take your money and forget about it.}
{1271}{}{I love old classics. But I wouldn't recommend watching it. You're too young for this, honey. Just take your money and forget about it.}
{272}{}{Okay.}
{273}{}{There's one more task. The pay will be good-500 hubbucks. But keep in mind, kid, I don't tolerate failure.}
{274}{}{Tell me what to do.}
{275}{}{Hold on, mister. Not a word more! You're talking about serious stuff. I'm out.}
{276}{}{Somewhere along the way to San Ysidro, a courier robot with an important part got lost. I need that part. Bring it to me. Move your butt, kid.}
{1276}{}{Somewhere along the way to San Ysidro, a courier robot with an important part got lost. I need that part. Move your legs, honey.}
{277}{}{[Leave]}
{278}{}{You're smart, kid. Alright, go take a walk. I don't need you anymore.}
{1278}{}{You're smart, honey. Alright, go take a walk. I don't need you anymore.}
{279}{}{[Leave]}
{280}{}{Can you be more specific about where the courier robot is?}
{281}{}{Somewhere along the way to San Ysidro. Most likely along the highway.}
{282}{}{Got it.}
{283}{}{Here's the part you were looking for.}
{284}{}{Good job! Never had such a sharp kid in the gang... uh, I mean team. Here's your reward. And I think I have no more tasks for you. You can rest now, kid.}
{1284}{}{Good job! I knew you wouldn't let me down, honey. Here's your reward. And I think I have no more tasks for you. You can rest now.}
{285}{}{[Leave]}
{1285}{}{Then I'll go have some fun. Goodbye, partner.}
{286}{}{By the way, why is this part labeled as Ed's property?}
{287}{}{Don't ask unnecessary questions, kid. I'm paying you for this.}
{1287}{}{Don't ask unnecessary questions, honey. I'm paying you for this.}
{288}{}{[Leave]}
{289}{}{Hey, kid, didn't you get something mixed up? I was told you gave the part to San Ysidro. What the hell does that mean?}
{1289}{}{Hey, honey, didn't you get something mixed up? I was told you gave the part to San Ysidro. What the hell does that mean?}
{290}{}{This isn't your thing, mister.}
{291}{}{Come to think of it, that's true. But what do you care? You work FOR ME. Damn, you really disappointed me, kid. I don't want to see you. Get lost!}
{1291}{}{Come to think of it, that's true. But what do you care? You work FOR ME. Damn, you really disappointed me, honey. I don't want to see you. Get lost!}
{292}{}{[Leave]}
{293}{}{Now, let's move on to some truly serious business. There's a camp of rogue scavengers nearby. They're combing through MY ruins and don't plan on paying any taxes. They should be working for me, and if they don't want to, then they can get off my land! Go deal with them.}
{294}{}{Will do.}
{295}{}{I refuse. Your bandit ambitions weren't part of my plans. I won't be an accomplice in shady schemes.}
{296}{}{You're disappointing me. I thought we were friends. And friends are hard to find these days. So, let me give you one last piece of advice: keep looking over your shoulder.}
{297}{}{I refuse to solve your problems with the scavengers.}
{298}{}{The problem with the scavengers has been resolved.}
{299}{}{Once again, you haven't let me down.}

# Services
{300}{}{I want to relax.}
{301}{}{Sorry, kid, but my services aren't suitable for smoothskins.}
{1301}{}{Sorry, honey, but my services aren't suitable for smoothskins.}
{302}{}{That's a shame.}
{303}{}{Not suitable at all? But my caps are just begging to be spent.}
{304}{}{Admit it, you just hate smoothskins, don't you?}
{305}{}{It's just business, kid. It's not in my interest for a client to boil alive. But since you're so sensitive, I can tell my ghoul friends that you're a good smoothskin. It'll cost you }
{1305}{}{It's just business, honey. It's not in my interest for a client to boil alive. But since you're so sensitive, I can tell my ghoul friends that you're a good smoothskin. It'll cost you }
{306}{}{No thanks. I'll earn a good reputation the honest way.}
{307}{}{Deal.}
{308}{}{Waiting for the caps, kid. Reputation is expensive.}
{1308}{}{Waiting for the caps, honey. Reputation is expensive.}
{309}{}{Okay.}
{310}{}{(quickly counts the caps) I give you my word - I'll come up with a great and believable story for you. All the ghouls will be impressed.}
{311}{}{I'm counting on you.}
{312}{}{Just no deceit. I don't like that.}
{313}{}{ caps. Deal?}

{320}{}{For starters, I suggest taking healing baths with my charming bath attendant. And if you have time and money to spare, I can offer a full stay at the hotel with movies, music, and therapeutic procedures. The service is specially for mutants and ghouls!}
{321}{}{I think I'll just stick to a simple bath for now. How much does it cost?}
{322}{}{ caps.}
{323}{}{Alright. Here are the caps.}
{324}{}{I'll think about it. How much does the full wellness package cost?}
{325}{}{Maybe another time.}
{326}{}{I'm interested in the second option.}
{327}{}{For }
{328}{}{ caps we'll provide a full range of procedures from uranium baths and massages to meditation and mushroom smoking. An ordinary ghoul sheds as much dirt as they collect in ten years.}
{329}{}{I like the sound of that! Here are the caps, I'm all yours.}
{330}{}{I don't have that much money. But a bath sounds good.}
{331}{}{For that much money, I'll arrange all these procedures myself! Goodbye.}
{1331}{}{For that much money, I'll arrange all these procedures myself! Goodbye.}
{332}{}{The therapeutic procedures have done you good. Your endurance has increased.}
{333}{}{The therapeutic procedures restored your health. Though you expected something more.}

{350}{}{I have one last task for you. There's a super mutant named Flowers. Right now, his lonely worthless body is wandering around Highway 805 searching for his purpose. Bring him to me. Tell him I'll take care of him if he works for me.}
{351}{}{Okay.}
{352}{}{Flowers is already here.}
{353}{}{He's here, kid! Flowers will be excellent protection for my property. And I have no more work for you. Here's your last paycheck. Congratulations on your retirement.}
{354}{}{[Leave]}
{355}{}{Flowers is dead.}
{356}{}{That's some damn bad news. And I don't like bad news. You've disappointed me, kid. Leave. I have no more work for you.}
{357}{}{[Leave]}
{358}{}{Flowers didn't want to work for you. He joined the scavengers.}
