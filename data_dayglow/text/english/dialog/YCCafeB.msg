{100}{}{You see a bartender.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary bartender... you'd like to say that, if he wasn't a ghoul.}
{102}{}{Those drunken brawls again! Stop them! They're going to wreck my bar!}

{210}{}{What do you want, you bag of bones?}
{211}{}{Nothing for now. Goodbye.}
{212}{}{I want a drink and a bite. What do you have?}

{220}{}{Is Steve Morgan here?}
{221}{}{He just left. Why do you need that walking corpse?}
{222}{}{I've got "business" with him. It's about courier work.}
{223}{}{Not the best choice. He's been craving money since the War, but can't even afford a new car. Haha, just kidding. Anyway, he said he was heading back to the Hub. He just mentioned it while sitting on the same stool you're on.}
{224}{}{When is he supposed to come back? Right now? I'll try to catch him on the highway...}
{225}{}{You should've mentioned that right away, idiot!}
{226}{}{What are those rogue scavengers doing here?}
{227}{}{My bar is open to anyone who pays. Butler doesn't mind people in the city either. He's trying to establish trade with the Hub. As long as the scavengers don't cause trouble, we tolerate them.}
{228}{}{Got it.}

{230}{}{Do you have anything stronger than old beer?}
{231}{}{Good liquor has become a big rarity. What they find in the ruins is usually sold to northern caravans, and the bar is left with whatever swill.}
{232}{}{That's a shame. I was hoping for a good drink...}
{233}{}{I can look for some supplies in the ruins for you.}
{234}{}{Bring it, and I'll gladly pay triple the price.}
{235}{}{Deal. I'll bring all the hard liquor I find in the ruins.}
{236}{}{You're in luck. I happen to have a bottle of pre-war whiskey with me.}
{237}{}{(Opens the bottle, sniffs, tastes.) Excellent quality! This drink is worth good money. Here's your share - }
{238}{}{ caps. Bring more if you find any.}
{239}{}{Definitely.}
{240}{}{I have a bottle of pre-war whiskey for your bar.}

{241}{}{Gomer and I are looking for his squad. Have you heard about it?}
{242}{}{I've heard that super mutants have set up camp in Balboa Park. They're not aggressive, quite the opposite. Maybe that's the squad you're looking for.}
{243}{}{Got it. Thanks.}

{260}{}{I want to exchange dollars for caps.}
{261}{}{No problem. Today's exchange rate is }
{262}{}{ caps.}
{263}{}{Not today. I'll wait for the exchange rate to change.}
{264}{}{Another time. Let me see your menu instead.}
{265}{}{[Exchange 1 dollar]}
{266}{}{[Exchange 2 dollars]}
{267}{}{[Exchange 3 dollars]}
{268}{}{[Exchange 4 dollars]}
{269}{}{[Exchange 5 dollars]}
{270}{}{[Exchange 10 dollars]}
{271}{}{[Exchange ALL available dollars]}
{272}{}{What's the matter, a hole in your pocket? It happens.}
{273}{}{Yeah, that's right...}
{274}{}{Here you go.}
{275}{}{Thanks.}

{280}{}{I want to rent a room to rest.}
{281}{}{For you, it will cost }
{282}{}{ caps.}
{283}{}{Why so much?}
{284}{}{Because you're a smooth-skin.}
{1284}{}{Because you're a smooth-skin.}
{285}{}{That's not fair!}
{286}{}{Don't like it? Sleep under the open sky.}
{287}{}{Alright, I'll pay for one night.}
{288}{}{No, thanks.}
{289}{}{I can't help you. All the rooms are, uh, occupied.}
{290}{}{Really? You're not lying?}
{291}{}{That's unfortunate.}
{292}{}{If we had free rooms, I'd rather give them to super mutants than to you.}
{293}{}{I'll remember that, greenie.}
{294}{}{Didn't want to anyway. Let's forget about it.}
{295}{}{You don't have enough caps for our service. Go earn some first.}
{296}{}{Fine.}
