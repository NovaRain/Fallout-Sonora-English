{100}{}{You see Knight Jerry.}
{101}{}{You see a Brotherhood of Steel knight. He looks quite worn out.}

{200}{}{Quiet! There's a mutant lurking at the entrance. He'll finish us if he sees us. And I'm wounded and can't fight. You're my last hope.}
{201}{}{The mutant left? Thank you, brother! Now I need to treat my wounds. Do you have a stimpak?}
{1201}{}{The mutant left? Thank you, sister! Now I need to treat my wounds. Do you have a stimpak?}
{202}{}{The mutant is dead? Thanks, brother! Now I need to treat my wounds. Do you have a stimpak?}
{1202}{}{The mutant is dead? Thanks, sister! Now I need to treat my wounds. Do you have a stimpak?}
{203}{}{I'm doing what I can. Stop complaining to me here!}
{204}{}{I'll do everything within my power.}
{205}{}{Thanks for the treatment. Now I can fight at full strength. Although I'm low on ammo. Where's that mutant? He must be waiting at the entrance.}
{206}{}{Let's go, let's give him a good beating!}
{207}{}{You better stay put so old wounds don't reopen. Stay here while I deal with that brute.}
{208}{}{The danger has passed. That brute has already left.}
{209}{}{That brute won't harm anyone anymore. We can leave our cover now.}
{210}{}{There he is! Careful!}
{211}{}{Don't shoot! This is Gomer, my partner.}
{212}{}{What the... I'm grateful to you for saving me, but this is too much! Mutants are evil! They've destroyed entire human settlements. Why the hell are you walking around with this piece of crap?}
{213}{}{He's harmless. There's no need to hate all mutants because of the actions of one specific group.}
{214}{}{I don't even know why I need him. But he protects me and carries things. Just don't touch him, okay?}
{215}{}{Who are you anyway? I knew a resident of a vault once. He tried to help his brothers and sisters. And when he did, he was just thrown outside. Kindness without weapons ends sadly.}
{1215}{}{Who are you anyway? I knew a resident of a vault once. He tried to help his brothers and sisters. And when he did, he was just thrown outside. Kindness without weapons ends sadly.}
{216}{}{Maybe so.}
{217}{}{Who knows?}
{218}{}{Ah, if only, six years ago, we had someone like you on the front lines-how many brothers could have been saved from super mutants!}
{219}{}{Back then, I worked on the plantations and didn't know anything about a war with super mutants. That's why I love my rural life.}
{220}{}{Enough that I managed to save you.}
{221}{}{Okay, now I need to find a place to clean up. Thanks, brother.}
{222}{}{By the way, what is the Brotherhood doing here?}
{223}{}{When the elders learned that mutants were heading to San Diego, they sent me and my squad for reconnaissance. I couldn't have imagined that a real hell was happening here. Radiation, monsters, super mutants, ghouls, robots-there's everything here! I need to report this to the commander. Ordinary people shouldn't come here either.}
{224}{}{Got it. Well then, safe travels. Try not to encounter mutants again.}
{225}{}{Thanks again.}
