{100}{}{You see a Far Go Trader.}
{101}{}{You see one of the caravan guards.}
{102}{}{Quiet! The main thing now is to stay out of those damn muties' sight.}
{103}{}{Whew! Now we can relax.}
{104}{}{Alright, I'm following you. You know how to get out of here unnoticed, right?}
{105}{}{Yeah, good idea. We need to stay low so they don't see us.}
{106}{}{The Far Go Trader is safe.}
{107}{}{What do they think they're doing? A little more and I'll beat their faces in!}

{110}{}{Thanks for saving us.}
{111}{}{Those super mutants would have ground us into dust if it weren't for you.}
{112}{}{Meeting you was a stroke of luck.}
{113}{}{The way back won't be any easier.}
{114}{}{I wonder if there's a bar around here?}

{120}{}{Rutger is gone. Who will negotiate with the ghouls?}
{121}{}{Without Rutger, the return trip will be especially tough.}
{122}{}{Because of Rutger's death, we might not get paid at all.}

{130}{}{After the explosion on the island, it became clear that NOTHING can be taken out of here.}
{131}{}{Gustavo is trying to drive us out of town. He's insane!}
{132}{}{Butler reached the naval base. Soon we'll be swimming in caps!}
{133}{}{}
{134}{}{The ghouls are scurrying around like ants after a napalm strike. Never seen anything like it. Well, it's good for our wallets.}
