{102}{}{Today we're feeling kind. But don't cross our path again.}
{103}{}{Death to normies!}
{104}{}{Save me from these stupid mutants!}
{105}{}{The last time I got roughed up like this was before the war. The mafia back then, mutants now - not much has changed.}
{106}{}{Phew, I thought I was done for. Here, take a stimpak and my thanks as a reward. Thank you, friend.}
{107}{}{}
{108}{}{}
{109}{}{}

{200}{}{Who do we have here? Come here, human! You'll be my dessert...}
{201}{}{Catch me first, idiot.}
{202}{}{Please, don't hurt me!}
{203}{}{My brothers said the same when normies were killing them. DIE, BITCH!}
{204}{}{Stop, scum!}
{205}{}{No, please...}
{206}{}{Listen, I'm trying to help the ghouls. Have mercy, we're not your enemies!}
{207}{}{You? Help? Ghouls? Ha-ha-ha, you made me laugh! Didn't know there were such fools.}
{1207}{}{You? Help? Ghouls? Ha-ha-ha, you made me laugh! Didn't know there were such fools.}
{208}{}{Please, let me and this ghoul go. No one here threatens you.}
{209}{}{Why am I even talking to you? Die, freaks!}
{210}{}{Someone like you isn't even worth dirtying my hands. Don't cross our path again.}
{211}{}{Phew, that was close...}
{212}{}{Here's another body. We're lucky with ghouls today. A good catch.}
{213}{}{You look big and menacing, but you're brainless.}
{214}{}{Please, don't hurt us! We're of the same blood!}
{215}{}{We're not enemies to each other. We're both mutants. Let's be friends?}
{216}{}{What did you say? Shut your mouth, scavenger! We're not filthy mutants, we're purebred soldiers of the Master!}
{217}{}{Seems like I just made him angrier...}
{1217}{}{Seems like I just made him angrier...}
{218}{}{Hmm, that's true. People hate us all for this. But it's all that unites us. We're not scavengers like you. We're purebred soldiers of the Master! Remember that, half-breed.}
{219}{}{Yes, sir. I will remember that.}
{220}{}{Gomer? I never thought you'd side with them.}
{221}{}{Yes, we decided to join forces. Is that so bad?}
{222}{}{Normies and Nightkin teaming up - never heard of that. But if Gomer is with you, we won't interfere.}
{223}{}{That's good then.}
