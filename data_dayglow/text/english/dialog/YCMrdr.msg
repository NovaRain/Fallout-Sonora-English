{100}{}{You see a ghoul scavenger.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul. He is carefully examining some items.}

{200}{}{Hey, stop, don't come any closer! These are my things, I found them!}
{201}{}{They were yours - now they're mine.}
{202}{}{Okay, as you say. These are your things.}
{203}{}{Hmm, it's rare to meet normal people here... Well, I mean it's rare now. Once, whole crowds walked these streets. Now, bones still stick out of the sand everywhere.}
{204}{}{What are you doing here?}
{205}{}{I'm looking for valuable items in these ruins. Scavengers rarely came here before because of the border robot. But someone did us a big favor by disabling it.}
{206}{}{Then I wish you luck. Goodbye.}
{207}{}{Have you found anything valuable yet?}
{208}{}{Yes, look here...}
{209}{}{[Barter]}
{210}{}{Hello, little human. Do you need any items from the ruins? I can look for some. I'm almost giving them away. And for you, there's a discount.}
{211}{}{Not today, senora.}
{212}{}{Show me what you have...}
{213}{}{Come back. Maybe in a couple of days, I'll find something else useful.}
{214}{}{Goodbye.}
{215}{}{Hey, do me a favor and don't touch my things. Okay? I found them!}
{216}{}{Hmm, so I'm not the only one in these ruins anymore... Once, whole crowds walked these streets. Now, bones still stick out of the sand everywhere.}
