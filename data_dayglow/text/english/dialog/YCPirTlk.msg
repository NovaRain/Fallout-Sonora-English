{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in combat armor and helmet.}

{200}{}{John spoke about you. Said you're a smart lad. But how do you plan to storm the island with such a smooth, baby face?}
{201}{}{Good question. I need to think about that.}
{202}{}{Not your ghoul face's business.}
{203}{}{John spoke about you. Said you're a smart lad. Hope you realize the risks waiting for you on the island?}
{204}{}{Good question. Probably should prepare for the landing in advance.}
{205}{}{I forgot to ask you.}
{206}{}{John spoke about you, but I didn't expect to see Gustavo's people here. What's going on?}
{207}{}{Yeah, he's short on people. Gustavo will oversee the operation.}
{208}{}{Gustavo will oversee the operation. Clear to you?}

{210}{}{Alright. Here's the plan. We have a transponder. Robots won't attack us while we're in its range. Just need to launch the boat and head to the island. Then we play it by ear.}
{211}{}{I need time to prepare. Wait a bit.}
{212}{}{Okay. What's my objective on the island?}

{220}{}{Isn't this base destroyed? What's there to take?}
{221}{}{The entire island was nuked. The land's still barren. But some underground levels survived. Robots emerge from there and get repaired. This base is one of the largest in pre-war America. Even after the blasts, there should be plenty of valuable relics left.}
{222}{}{There's probably heavy radiation there.}
{223}{}{Right. That's why only ghouls and robots can work there. It works in our favor, though. But you'll need to prepare well to avoid getting fried by isotopic rays.}
{224}{}{What's stopped you from landing there until now?}
{225}{}{Coronado Island's guns. Part survived under shields during the bombings. They stretch along the entire coastline, keeping us from getting too close. Plus concrete fortifications, debris in the water, underwater mines, and patrolling robots. Plus, we didn't have the transponder until recently, which we got from the aviation factory. Good job, by the way.}
{226}{}{What's my objective on the island?}
{227}{}{Your job, smooth face, is to disable the security system so robots and guns stop firing at everyone. After that, we'll handle the rest.}

{250}{}{Ah! Do you feel that beautiful fresh air?}
{251}{}{I only feel radioactive dust from scorched earth.}
{252}{}{Well, tastes vary. Don't forget-your goal is to disable the security system. We'll take it from there. Just don't go touching everything; there are still plenty of dangerous military toys that could turn you into charcoal.}
{253}{}{Got it, Captain Obvious.}
{1253}{}{Task understood, Captain Obvious.}
{254}{}{Alright.}
{255}{}{Your goal is to disable the security system. We'll handle the rest. You can head back to the mainland.}
{256}{}{Combat alert deactivated. Access to the base is open to all interested parties.}
{257}{}{Great job! We'll take it from here. You can head back to the mainland.}
{258}{}{Okay.}
{259}{}{By the way, what are you planning to do with the local findings?}
{260}{}{Take them out, of course. Anything useful, from ammo to electronics, goes towards enhancing Dayglow or for sale.}
{261}{}{So some of these dangerous toys will end up in people's hands?}
{262}{}{Of course. Any problems with that?}
{263}{}{No, sir. None.}
{264}{}{Idiot! Those things in the wrong hands will be a disaster! I won't allow you to take anything from here.}
{265}{}{Anything useful, from ammo to electronics, goes towards improving Dayglow.}
{266}{}{Alright.}
