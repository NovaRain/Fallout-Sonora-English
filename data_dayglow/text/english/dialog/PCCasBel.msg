{100}{}{You see a bellboy.}
{101}{}{You see a very helpful young man with an ingratiating gaze.}
{102}{}{Y-you're not really planning to stay here, are you?}
{103}{}{Sorry, buddy, but I'm not allowed to serve an ass like you.}
{1103}{}{Sorry, but I'm not allowed to serve a bitch like you.}

{200}{}{How may I serve you, sir?}
{1200}{}{How may I help you, ma'am?}
{201}{}{Who are you?}
{202}{}{I'm a bellhop. I do small tasks for a small fee.}
{203}{}{I see.}
{204}{}{Any progress? I definitely have... Hehe.}

{210}{}{Good night, sir.}
{1210}{}{Good night, ma'am.}
{211}{}{Good morning, sir.}
{1211}{}{Good morning, ma'am.}
{212}{}{Good afternoon, sir.}
{1212}{}{Good afternoon, ma'am.}
{213}{}{Good evening, sir.}
{1213}{}{Good evening, ma'am.}
{214}{}{My respects, sir.}
{1214}{}{My respects, ma'am.}
{218}{}{I see.}
{219}{}{Bye.}

{220}{}{What is this place?}
{221}{}{It's a casino, and there's also a small hotel on the second floor. You can relax and gamble here.}
{222}{}{Remind me, what are you doing here?}
{223}{}{Running errands, sir. I'm a bellhop.}
{1223}{}{Running errands, ma'am. I'm a bellhop.}
{224}{}{What are you doing here?}
{225}{}{So this is a hotel?}
{226}{}{I want to rent a room.}
{227}{}{There is one available room. That'll be }
{228}{}{ caps for the night.}
{229}{}{No, I changed my mind.}
{1229}{}{No, I changed my mind.}
{230}{}{Too bad I don't have that many caps.}
{231}{}{Okay. Here's the caps.}
{232}{}{You are well-rested and energized.}

# Luxury furnishings
{250}{}{I'm staying in a suite. Can you get some furniture in there?}
{1250}{}{I'm staying in a suite. Can you get some furniture in there?}
{251}{}{Of course, sir. What do you need?}
{1251}{}{Of course, ma'am. What do you need?}
{252}{}{Actually, it's already pretty cluttered in there.}
{253}{}{A toilet. [5 caps]}
{254}{}{A small shelves for things. [20 caps]}
{255}{}{A spacious closet. [50 caps]}
{256}{}{A refrigerator. [50 caps]}
{257}{}{}
{258}{}{Ahem. Caps first.}
{259}{}{Yeah, yeah, uh, sure...}
{260}{}{All ready, sir.}
{1260}{}{All ready, ma'am.}
{261}{}{Great.}
{262}{}{Huh. Service is terrible when there's no competition.}

#Improving skill
{300}{}{Tell me, are the games in this casino really fair?}
{301}{}{Honestly... Yes, I guess.}
{302}{}{Why are you hesitant?}
{303}{}{Well, it depends a lot on the odds. And generally, they're slightly better for the casino than for the player. But that doesn't mean you can't win and get rich.}
{304}{}{Tell me how to do it. There must be all sorts of tricks?}
{305}{}{Uh, no. (looks towards the guard and lowers his voice) The boss would't like it.}
{306}{}{No one will know about this. (tempt him by showing off your caps)}
{307}{}{Then forget it.}
{308}{}{Hey, everything for our clients. For 300 caps, I'll give a small... master class, yes. "How to increase your chances by five percent and why that matters." Something like that.}
{309}{}{I can easily win back my caps if your tips work. When do we start?}
{310}{}{I can't afford it. See you.}
{311}{}{Meet me at the pool table on the second floor. And, uh, don't forget about the caps.}
{312}{}{No problem.}

{320}{}{I'm ready to start when you are.}
{321}{}{Here's 300 caps. }
{322}{}{Hang on a bit. I'll need to get my caps.}
{323}{}{Thank you. (looks around and hides the caps) Let's start with the general rules...}
{324}{}{[Continue]}
{325}{}{...And never do a split on fives, then the sum will be ten.}
{326}{}{Holy shit, this isn't easy. Now I know exactly what NOT to do.}
{327}{}{That's all I know. Ultimately, that five percent luck will decide your fate in the game. Okay, I'm gonna split before the boss suspects anything.}
{328}{}{Thanks for the tips, pal.}
{329}{}{Hit the road, I don't need you anymore.}
