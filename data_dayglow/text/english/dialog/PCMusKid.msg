{100}{}{You see a young beggar.}
{101}{}{You see a girl with two maracas, trying to perform something.}
{102}{}{Thank you, sir.}
{1102}{}{Thank you, ma'am.}
{103}{}{Keep back!}
{104}{}{Yawns and rubs her eyes quietly.}

{200}{}{(The girl notices you and starts shaking her maracas, singing a barely coherent tune). ~ The cockroach, the cockroach. He can no longer run away... ~}
{201}{}{[Listen]}
{202}{}{[Pass by]}
{203}{}{~ All because, all because... He lost his legs in a fight ~}
{204}{}{[Listen further]}
{205}{}{~ Without his legs, it's tough, it's hard. But he keeps running, running, running ~}
{206}{}{[Listen further]}
{207}{}{~ And without stopping, and without looking back. He wants to live, he wants to live ~}
{208}{}{}
{209}{}{(She quietly extends a begging jar.)}
{210}{}{I don't have anything valuable now. Maybe next time.}
{211}{}{Here's a cap, treat yourself.}
{212}{}{Take two caps; you've earned them.}
{213}{}{Take these three caps and spend them on food.}
{214}{}{Feeling generous today. Here's four caps.}
{1214}{}{Feeling generous today. Here's four caps.}
{215}{}{I can't bear to see you suffer. Here, take these five caps.}
{216}{}{That sound is torture! Spare us from hearing it again.}
{217}{}{Bravo! You're quite talented, young lady.}
{218}{}{Interesting song, but your performance could use some work.}

{220}{}{Thank you, sir...}
{1220}{}{Thank you, ma'am...}
{221}{}{Could've been more polite, but I suppose that's asking too much...}
{222}{}{You're welcome. I hope this helps.}

{230}{}{You silly girl, it's your caps I'll be taking!}
{231}{}{(She shakes her head silently, horrified, stepping back.)}
{232}{}{Apologies if I seemed erratic. I won't take anything from you, of course.}
{233}{}{Don't move! Hand over your caps!}
{234}{}{(The girl deftly slips away from your grasp, taking advantage of your clumsiness)}
{235}{}{Run while you can, you little brat! I'll catch you eventually!}
{236}{}{Consider yourself lucky this time.}
{237}{}{Let go! (Holding the girl's elbow, you find ten caps and pocket them.) Someone! Help!}
{238}{}{You're dead if you try to get help. Now get lost.}
{239}{}{You're free to go. I was only interested in the caps.}
