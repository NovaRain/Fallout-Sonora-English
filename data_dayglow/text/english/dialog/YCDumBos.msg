{100}{}{You see Isaac.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in worn-out work clothes.}
{102}{}{Looks like I have to do everything myself again...}
{1102}{}{Looks like I have to do everything myself again...}
{103}{}{Great job... for a smoothskin.}
{104}{}{This is the engine room. I hope everything works here; otherwise, the station will be useless.}
{105}{}{We're almost there. Lead me to the control panel in the control room.}

{200}{}{Never thought I'd see a normie here. You must have a burr up your ass?}
{201}{}{Newbie and straight into the fire? That's what I like to see! But be careful, it's very dangerous here.}
{1201}{}{Newbie and straight into the fire? That's what I like to see! But be careful, it's very dangerous here.}
{202}{}{Senor Gustavo sent me. How can I help you?}
{203}{}{And what are you doing here?}
{204}{}{We're trying to do the impossible - get the dam to generate electricity. But the top has been taken over by military robots since the nuclear war. They don't let anyone inside.}
{205}{}{Where do you need to go?}
{206}{}{I need to get to the control center. It's somewhere underground. Try to find a safe path. I'm not ready to become part of the local flora just yet.}
{207}{}{Alright. But first, I'll try to do it myself.}
{208}{}{Then come with me. I know how to bypass the robots.}
{209}{}{First, tell me, what is this place?}
{210}{}{This is the Bonita Dam. It was created to store water. The power plant was built during the crisis times when there was a shortage of liquid fuel. Its capacity is barely enough for Dayglow's needs. But there's no other surviving station in the city.}
{211}{}{I need to get to the control center. I think we're on the right track.}
{212}{}{This is the control center. Looks like it hasn't been cleaned in ages. No matter, we're used to it... And this must be the control panel? Just a moment... There... Done. Hm-m. The station is mothballed. We'll have to work manually.}
{213}{}{What needs to be done?}
{214}{}{We need to start the second turbine in the engine room. It might take a lot of effort there.}
{215}{}{Got it.}
{216}{}{This is the engine room. But now we need to get to the control center.}
{217}{}{Wait here.}
{218}{}{Follow me.}

{220}{}{This dam will remain a pathetic piece of concrete until we get it to work for Dayglow's benefit.}
{221}{}{Don't tell me you're lost.}
{1221}{}{Don't tell me you're lost.}
{222}{}{Wait a bit. I'll be back soon.}
{223}{}{What needs to be done now?}
{224}{}{The second turbine is spinning.}
{225}{}{Hm, if the turbine is working, why isn't there any power? Maybe some wires are burnt out. Check the entire circuit from the turbine to this room.}
{226}{}{You've got to be kidding me...}
{227}{}{Alright.}
{228}{}{Seems like there's no break in the circuit now.}
{229}{}{Indeed... Now I'll send power to the substation... Damn, the substation isn't responding. It must be mothballed too. You'll have to go there and start it up. Remember: we need to direct the power strictly to the power lines in San Ysidro and the Old Town. Other circuits need to be shut off.}
{230}{}{Got it!}
{231}{}{Seems like I'm doing all the work here...}
{232}{}{Bonita! Do you hear that wonderful crackling in the transformers and the hum in the wires? I haven't heard anything like it in ages. Thank you, amigo. I hope Gustavo rewards you well. Here, take a Geiger counter. It'll come in handy on your way to San Ysidro.}
{233}{}{Goodbye, Isaac.}
{234}{}{But there are impassable ruins between the power plant and the residential areas...}
{235}{}{You're sharp! Even though you're not from our era. We're ghouls, but we've already launched several work robots and prepared the power lines. It doesn't take much.}
