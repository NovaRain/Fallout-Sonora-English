{210}{}{Copy geographic data.}
{211}{}{Geographic data successfully added to the maps section of your Pip-Boy.}

{220}{}{Information about Vault 25}
{221}{}{Vault Number: 25. Construction started: March 2064. Completed: January 2068. Contractor: Vault-Tec. Purpose: Protection of civilians during a nuclear strike. Capacity: 450 inhabitants. Sealing Duration: 15 years.}
{222}{}{Vault 25 History}
{223}{}{During the Great War in 2077, the vault opened to the citizens of Phoenix. However, the proximity and suddenness of the nuclear strikes forced the workers to seal the armored door early, allowing only 12% of the planned residents inside.}
{224}{}{[More]}
{225}{}{Abundant resources and space allowed the survivors to live comfortably without venturing to the surface. The vault was opened and colonized by Ulysses Grant's expedition in 2162.}
{226}{}{Resident Characteristics}
{227}{}{Vault residents had excellent physical health but poor stamina, making them unsuitable for hard labor. Mental health remained generally good, though many had phobias about the outside world.}

{230}{}{Medical Experiments}
{231}{}{The Followers of Fire conduct various medical experiments using the well-preserved equipment in the vault.}
{232}{}{Projects in Development}
{233}{}{Increased radiation resistance, enhanced combat effectiveness of guards through chemical means, antivirus for "wasteland disease".}
{234}{}{Suspended Projects}
{235}{}{Standard Med-Tec vaccinations (due to raw material shortages), remote mind control (due to lack of equipment).}

{240}{}{Affordable Food Project}
{241}{}{The Followers of Fire are researching ways to solve Phoenix's food shortage. This includes plant experiments (transferred to Casa Nueva), mushroom and microbiological farms, new food processor production in Two-Sun, and GECK technology research.}
{242}{}{What is this GECK?}
{243}{}{Garden of Eden Creation Kit - ancient technology for restoring the earth post-nuclear strike. The technology is too complex to replicate in Vault 25's laboratory conditions. The Followers have sent expeditions to other vaults in search of a working GECK.}
{244}{}{Expedition to Vault 26}
{245}{}{Vault 26 was destroyed by a nuclear attack, the GECK was not preserved.}
{246}{}{Expedition to Vault 27}
{247}{}{Excavations are currently led by Arthur Carrington. Vault coordinates are attached. The presence of the GECK in the vault has not been confirmed.}

{250}{}{Nuclear Bomb Project}
{251}{}{Construction of the Baby Phoenix uranium bomb using materials from Flagstaff. Curator: Professor Zach Zimmer. Completion: 92%.}
{252}{}{Disable the force field in the nuclear bomb section.}
{253}{}{Force field deactivated.}

{260}{}{Reports on Shipments of Uranium and Slaves}
{261}{}{(This quarterly routine report describes uranium from Flagstaff and slaves from the region. They are partly used by the cult and partly convoyed south through Two-Sun.)}
{262}{}{Search for information about Villa slaves.}
{263}{}{(You find information about several prisoners from Villa. Unfortunately, they have already been sent to Two-Sun.)}
