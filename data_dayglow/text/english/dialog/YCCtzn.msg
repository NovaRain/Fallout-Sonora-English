{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary ghoul.}

{102}{}{Oh, thanks, you're just in time.}
{103}{}{Hey, this food's cold! Oh well, can't be helped. Hand it over.}
{104}{}{Do you enjoy delivering food? Thanks.}
{105}{}{This is just what I wanted!}
{106}{}{Thanks. But I don't have any tips.}

{108}{}{) of the clients have received their order.}
{109}{}{This client has already received their order.}

{110}{}{Oh my gosh, it's a human!}
{111}{}{Smoothskins in Dayglow? I can't believe my eyes!}
{112}{}{What do these normies think they're doing?}
{113}{}{Just what we needed, more smoothskins.}
{114}{}{Even here, the smoothskins are bothering us.}

{115}{}{This normie can be trusted.}
{116}{}{A human in Dayglow? Lunatic!}
{117}{}{Normies made a mistake. They need time to realize it.}
{118}{}{Maybe not all smoothskins are bad.}
{119}{}{We just want to live apart from the smoothskins.}

{120}{}{Even here, the smoothskins are bothering us.}
{121}{}{Guess what my line is?}
{122}{}{Dayglow is a wonderful city.}
{123}{}{Too bad Harold isn't with us. He went north.}
{124}{}{Don't move! I dropped my brains... Haha, my favorite joke.}
{125}{}{Still, I'll miss the Necropolis.}
{126}{}{Necropolis is deader than ever now.}
{127}{}{I still shudder remembering Set's gaze.}
{128}{}{Where's my hair? I left it in '77. Ha ha ha!}
{129}{}{Sometimes I vaguely recall something from my past life.}

{130}{}{Everyone who could headed to Coronado Island.}
{131}{}{There hasn't been such a stir among ghouls for a long time!}
{132}{}{Whoever opened the way to Coronado for us is our hero.}
{133}{}{Coronado is ours now!}
{134}{}{Now we'll live it up with the stuff from Coronado!}

{135}{}{I had such plans for Coronado...}
{136}{}{Coronado could have been a Klondike. Such a shame.}
{137}{}{There's nothing left of Coronado Island.}
{138}{}{An old bomb exploded on the island. I wonder if it was by itself or with someone's help?}
{139}{}{I was so lucky not to be on the pier when it exploded.}

{150}{}{Standing, boss! Standing as still as a post!}
{151}{}{My respects, officer.}
{152}{}{I'm a law-abiding citizen.}
{153}{}{It's nice to see remnants of the law in the wastelands... Oh, wait, that's not your badge!}
{154}{}{You must have nearly a hundred years of service, huh?}
{155}{}{Some people played with the law like that. Ended up starting World War III.}
{156}{}{Am I under arrest?}
