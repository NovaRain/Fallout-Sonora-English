{100}{}{You see Father Thalius.}
{101}{}{You see a mutant in a worn-out shirt and hat. A cross hangs around his neck.}
{102}{}{You see Thalius, a member of the Followers sect, standing before you.}
{103}{}{Give this to someone who truly deserves to wear it.}
{104}{}{Fernando stayed in town.}
{105}{}{Beatriz stayed in town.}

#First Meeting
{200}{}{Greetings, brother. My name is Thalius. I'm glad to see you in Dayglow. Do you need any help?}
{1200}{}{Greetings, sister. My name is Thalius. I'm glad to see you in Dayglow. Do you need any help?}
{201}{}{You're no brother of mine. Have you even looked in a mirror?}
{202}{}{I see, you're not too bright either. I used to be the same. But studying with the Followers made me smarter.}
{203}{}{Doesn't your skull feel tight?}
{204}{}{You know, it does sometimes. I have to trim some extra brain tissue through this hole in... Oh, you must mean something else. Sorry. I get carried away sometimes. Do you need some brain assistance?}
{205}{}{Sorry, I just mean that there's a lot of difference between us.}
{206}{}{Yeah, maybe. So, do you need my help?}
{207}{}{I'm just here to check out this place.}
{1207}{}{I'm just here to check out this place.}
{208}{}{Thanks for the warm welcome. It's surprising to hear that in a place like this.}
{209}{}{I understand. Ghouls are suspicious of normies. They've been through too much harassment. But show them you're good, and they'll welcome you.}
{210}{}{I hope so. But why are you so friendly?}
{211}{}{That was sarcasm, idiot! I'd never befriend freaks like you.}
{212}{}{Sorry to hear that. I hope you'll change your mind in time. Do you need some brain assistance?}

{220}{}{Greetings, brother. Do you need any help?}
{1220}{}{Greetings, sister. Do you need any help?}
{221}{}{No, thanks. Sorry for bothering you.}
{222}{}{What do you want to know?}
{223}{}{Nothing more. Thanks for your time.}
{224}{}{A lot, but you wouldn't know anything anyway. Bye.}
{225}{}{Soon, big changes are coming to Dayglow. And after that, changes will come to the rest of the world. It's both frightening and exciting... Do you need any help?}

#About the Followers
{230}{}{This is the chapel of the Followers of the Apocalypse. Here, I help ghouls understand our teachings.}
{231}{}{Sorry to interrupt. But I want to change the subject.}
{232}{}{I know some Followers. We met in Casa Nueva.}
{233}{}{Then you know enough. The Followers of the Apocalypse are good people. They want to bring peace to this cursed land.}
{234}{}{Where are the other Followers?}
{235}{}{I'm the only one here. Only ghouls and mutants can live among these irradiated ruins. But most Followers are ordinary people. Their main base is in another city.}
{236}{}{How did you become a Follower if you're... well... a ghoul?}
{237}{}{Would you believe if I told you I have a different nature? The Followers saved me from turning into a horrible beast while I was unconscious under the effect of a mutagen. After that, they let me share in their knowledge. They are kind people.}
{238}{}{I see.}
{239}{}{What is this teaching?}
{240}{}{The Followers of the Apocalypse want to bring peace to this cursed land. They preach altruism and non-violence. They use pre-war knowledge to improve people's lives. But the most important thing is they won't let humanity repeat the mistake of 2077.}
{241}{}{Tell me about your faith.}
{242}{}{Your words about the Followers moved me deeply. I want to make a donation.}
{243}{}{That's noble of you. How many habbucks can you spare for good causes?}
{244}{}{Right now, none. I mean, I'll do it in the future.}
{245}{}{100 caps.}
{246}{}{200 caps.}
{247}{}{300 caps.}
{248}{}{400 caps.}
{249}{}{500 caps.}
{250}{}{Thanks. Have a good day!}
{251}{}{You're welcome.}
{252}{}{I feel relieved. But I'd like to talk to you more, Father Thalius.}

#About Himself
{260}{}{Remind me, what's your name?}
{261}{}{I'm Thalius.}
{262}{}{Alright, Thalius.}
{263}{}{Where are you from, Thalius?}
{264}{}{My homeland is far from here, in an old vault numbered 13.}
{265}{}{I know about several vaults, but I'm hearing about 13 for the first time.}
{266}{}{Never heard of such a place.}
{1266}{}{Never heard of such a place.}
{267}{}{Of course. There were many such vaults. And many of them are no longer operational these days.}
{268}{}{Did the other ghouls come from Vault 13 too?}
{269}{}{Never mind. Let's change the subject.}
{270}{}{Most of them are from Vault 12, which is under the city of Necropolis. I used to go there looking for parts for my vault. That's when I mutated.}
{271}{}{So, you're not a ghoul?}
{272}{}{Sad story. We should change the subject.}
{273}{}{A mutant. The Master's scientists made me this way. They tried to turn me into a super mutant, but something went wrong.}
{274}{}{A mutant. The Master's scientists made me this way. They tried to turn me into a super mutant, but something went wrong. And it seems something similar happened to you.}
{275}{}{That's really awful. I wish I could help you.}
{1275}{}{That's really awful. I wish I could help you.}
{276}{}{Thanks for the kind words. You know, I used to be an atheist. But after fate made me immortal, you start to believe in God's plan. Maybe it's just a trial?}
{277}{}{I suppose it's hard to be like that. But nothing can be done about it.}
{278}{}{You know, I used to be an atheist. But after fate made me immortal, you start to believe in God's plan. Maybe it's just a trial?}
{279}{}{Shall we talk about something else?}
{280}{}{Good luck, Father Thalius.}

{290}{}{I remembered a conversation about vaults. Are there any in Dayglow?}
{291}{}{Perhaps. Why are you asking?}
{292}{}{Just logical reasoning. Don't mind it.}
{293}{}{Well, I came across this thing. I think it's somehow related to vaults.}
{294}{}{A flask from Vault 24... A relic from ancient times. Where did you get it?}
{295}{}{Found it on a skeleton in a jumpsuit. I think the skeleton has been lying in the ruins for many decades.}
{296}{}{It could be one of the scouts the Followers sent out for reconnaissance. Many good people died in those harsh times.}
{297}{}{Did the Followers also come out of a vault?}
{298}{}{Those who were the forefathers of the Followers did. The others were born after leaving the vault or joined from the outside.}
{299}{}{What happened to this vault?}
{300}{}{I don't know the full story. The vault is now useless. The Followers took everything valuable from there. Besides, terrible creatures roam those places. I don't advise going there.}
{301}{}{I'll take the risk anyway. At least for the sake of history. Show me the way.}
{302}{}{The vault can wait. I don't want any dangerous adventures right now.}
{303}{}{It's located in the center of Otay Park. It's hard to find, so I'll plot the route on your Pip-Boy.}
{304}{}{[Head there right now.]}
{305}{}{Not now. I need to prepare for the journey.}
{306}{}{I'll take the risk anyway. Maybe not everything has been taken from there yet? Show me the way.}
{307}{}{Isn't it a bit brazen of you to barge into someone else's domain? Everything here belongs to the ghouls. Many don't even like you being here. I'll show you the vault, but in return, I expect a generous donation. Let's say, 1000 caps.}
{308}{}{I can't spend that much. Let's put this question off for now?}
{309}{}{Alright. Here are 1000 caps. Show me the way.}
{310}{}{In return, you'll stay alive, jerk. That's the best you can hope for.}
{311}{}{I need to get back to Vault 24. Right now.}
{312}{}{Help me get into Vault 24.}

{320}{}{Can I help your people with anything?}
{321}{}{Our souls need saving, but we manage the rest. I was recently informed of another victim of madness: our friend Gonzo went berserk and fled to the ruins of Chula Vista. In this state, he's dangerous. He needs to be stopped.}
{322}{}{Can it be done without deaths?}
{323}{}{Are you asking me to KILL him?}
{324}{}{(sigh) Would any ghoul raise a hand against a fellow ghoul? I don't think so. Many ghouls would condemn it. But there is no cure for madness. We can only do one thing - avoid unnecessary casualties.}
{325}{}{Just chop off his head - it's that simple.}
{326}{}{I've seen this kind of madness in Inferno before. Only death can stop it.}
{327}{}{You can't just take lives like that! If there's no other way, we'll have to send Gonzo to his ancestors. But remember, Gonzo is our brother. Ghouls have lived with him for many years in the Necropolis. Show at least a little compassion.}
{328}{}{Is there any way to temporarily restore his sanity?}
{329}{}{In some cases, medications help, in others - triggers from the past. Or maybe nothing will help. But any solution is temporary.}
{330}{}{I'll think of something.}
{331}{}{God be with you.}
{332}{}{I'll be back.}
{333}{}{I have a few more questions.}
{334}{}{If even you can't deal with your own kind, I certainly won't be able to. Sorry.}
{335}{}{I understand. In that case, just avoid Gonzo if you see him in the ruins.}
{336}{}{Remind me where to find Gonzo?}
{337}{}{He was last seen in the old shopping district in the ruins of Chula Vista. That area is to the north.}
{338}{}{Got it.}
{339}{}{}
{340}{}{Gonzo is dead. He left me no choice!}
{341}{}{Well, now his soul will rest. (sigh) Okay. I don't hold any grudge against you. I'm just mad at myself for not being able to help the deranged. Apparently, all ghouls will end up like this sooner or later. There is no cure for madness.}
{342}{}{Don't blame yourself. Life goes on.}
{343}{}{He was a danger to society. You know that yourself.}
{344}{}{Thanks for your kind words.}
{345}{}{Let's change the subject.}
{346}{}{Now Gonzo is no longer a threat, right?}
{347}{}{Thank you. Mad Gonzo is securely locked behind bars. Apparently, all ghouls will end up like this sooner or later. There is no cure for madness. All that's left is to lock up Gonzo to avoid unnecessary casualties. If you ever need help for your soul or body, I'll try to help.}
{348}{}{Just don't lock me up behind bars!}
{349}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}

#Healing
{350}{}{Do you heal diseases?}
{351}{}{The Followers taught me basic medical procedures. But medications here are very expensive and rare. What ails you?}
{352}{}{I need treatment.}
{353}{}{Nothing. Just curious.}
{354}{}{ caps]}
{355}{}{[Healing wounds for }
{356}{}{[Healing serious injuries for }
{357}{}{[Healing radiation sickness for }
{358}{}{[Healing poisoning for }
{359}{}{You are fine.}
{360}{}{Thank you.}
{361}{}{[Healing Gomer for }
{362}{}{He is fine.}


{380}{}{It's a strange situation here, Doc. It's Donovan. And he's dead.}
{381}{}{Really?}
{382}{}{But his friends can't believe it. What should I do now?}
{383}{}{Dead, you say? Donovan? Come on, of course he's alive!}
{384}{}{Are you out of your mind too? Are all of you crazy here?}
{385}{}{Look, he's not breathing. And half of his body is missing. He's dead.}
{386}{}{Bring him here. I'll take care of him. But...}
{387}{}{But what?}
{388}{}{I'm afraid I can't help him without some items. Do you know where the hospital is? I need to get three vials of biogel from there.}
{389}{}{You really are crazy. I'm going to mind my own business.}
{390}{}{Well, you know best. I'll try to get the parts and the biogel.}
{391}{}{I have what you need.}
{392}{}{Excellent! Well, let's not waste time - let's start the operation.}
{393}{}{Uh, okay...}
{394}{}{(The operation takes several hours behind closed doors. You wait outside. Finally, Thalius comes out and loudly declares: "Donovan will live!")}
{395}{}{Wow, Thalius, you really work miracles!}
{396}{}{Yeah, right. I don't believe it. Well, goodbye, charlatan Thalius.}
{397}{}{About Donovan.}
