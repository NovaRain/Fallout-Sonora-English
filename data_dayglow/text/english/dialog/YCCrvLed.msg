{100}{}{You see Rutger.}
{101}{}{You see the leader of the Far Go Traders.}
{102}{}{Quiet! We'll talk when we reach camp.}
{103}{}{Rutger headed to the caravan camp.}
{104}{}{Don't come closer, mutant! I'll kill you, damn it!}

{200}{}{I expected to see anyone here, but not a normal human.}
{201}{}{The ghouls sent me to help.}
{202}{}{Mutants ambushed us. Luckily, we spotted them in time and turned to the warehouses. They're hesitant to attack for now, but it's just a matter of time. Can you get us out of here unnoticed?}
{203}{}{I think I can. I managed to get in here, didn't I?}
{204}{}{Great. Then let's act one by one. First, get my subordinates out.}
{205}{}{Alright.}
{206}{}{I'll distract the mutants while you get the guards out. It'll be harder for us to hide from the super mutants together.}
{207}{}{Okay.}
{208}{}{I'm the last one, right? Then let's move out!}
{209}{}{Let's go.}
{210}{}{It's too dangerous to leave now. We need to wait a bit.}
{211}{}{I saw the mutants leave along the road. But it could be a trap. Try to get my subordinates out first.}
{212}{}{I doubt we can leave unnoticed. How about attacking the enemy first?}
{213}{}{I can't risk my people. We'll use cunning. First, get the guards out.}
{214}{}{Soon there will be more people here than ghouls. Looks like you need help?}
