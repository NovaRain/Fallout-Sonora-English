{100}{}{You see a hermit.}
{101}{}{You see a hairy, overgrown man in dirty rags. It's clear he hasn't washed in years.}
{102}{}{Threaten? Wah!}

{200}{}{Hmm... It's been a while since I talked to anyone. Talking is hard.}
{201}{}{I don't want to talk either. Let's just part ways.}

{210}{}{It was good talking. Now go away. I'm tired.}
{211}{}{Talking gives me a headache. Leave.}
{212}{}{I've talked enough for today. Enough.}
{213}{}{Bye.}

{220}{}{Why are you living out here, all alone like this?}
{221}{}{Want to be alone. Peace.}
{222}{}{Are there any settlements nearby?}
{223}{}{Hermosillo is over there. (points) Don't go. Dangerous.}
{224}{}{Two-Sun is that way. (points) Don't go. Dangerous.}
{225}{}{Do you have anything to trade?}
{226}{}{A bit, here's what I have.}
{227}{}{Well, I gotta go.}
{228}{}{Santa Ana is over there. (points) Nice place.}
