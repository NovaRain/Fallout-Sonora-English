PID_DOCTORS_BAG (91) + PID_PARAMEDICS_BAG (409) + PID_FIRST_AID_KIT (47) + PID_FIELD_MEDIC_KIT (408) - engine mechanics of healing.

47-57, 59-66, 294, 308 - city reputation variables. Each location is assigned a specific variable by the engine.

>> Maps

[Map 021] - the name and number of the starting map ARTEMPLE.MAP are hardcoded in the engine.
The starting coordinates of the main character on the world map are written in the engine, and changing them via city.txt results in the initial cell being marked as visited.
[Map 19] and [Map 37] - at some point the entry point level changes via the map script.
[Map 149] - a map of a forced meeting with Horrigan.
[Area 22] - destroyed Arroyo, appears instead of Arroyo after showing one of Hakunin's dreams.
