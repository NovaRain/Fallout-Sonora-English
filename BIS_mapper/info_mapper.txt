=============  Fallout Sonora: Editor Keys and Options

>> Notes:

The editor behaves incorrectly if the CapsLock key is active.
You can move already placed and configured objects across map levels by holding them with the cursor and pressing Page Up or Page Down.
To make the pro-file editor work, you need to create a folder in the root disk: DISK/fallout2/dev/PROTO/... (instead of the ellipsis of the profile folder: CRITTERS, SCENERY, etc.)
In the Fallout 2 file system, no more than 8 characters are allowed in the file name, otherwise such a file will not be found by the engine or script. This applies to anything - sprites, sounds, scripts, location maps, etc.


>> For the world map (works only in pseudo-game mode):

D - displays the names of encounters for each tile, when pressed again, removes the inscriptions and makes all tiles covered with fog of war again.
F - initiates a random encounter at the hero's current position on the world map. Shift+F allows you to select a specific encounter from the WORLDMAP.TXT list (first, the Encounter Table number is selected, then the encounter number enc_ inside it)
H - displays all available locations on the world map, except for hidden ones. Shift+H also displays hidden locations (marked with start_state=Off in CITY.TXT).
C - switches between walking and driving.
Alt+LMB - teleports the hero to the click point on the map.
F1 - displays the cursor coordinates on the world map (relevant for the city.txt file).


>> For local maps:

Ctrl+Enter - calls the window for adding items to the hero's inventory.
Alt+LMB - teleports the hero to the click point on the map (only in pseudo-game mode).
F8 - enters or exits the game mode (after exiting the game mode, you must reopen the map).
I - shows the names of their scripts above objects.
U - opens/closes the selected door or container.
K - kills/resurrects the selected critter (K+Shift - kills with a choice of death type).
S - creates a new trigger (after pressing, click the mouse on the target hex of the map to place the trigger there).


>> Indices of sounds of opening/closing containers (parameter Sound ID):

A - refrigerator
B - metal cabinet, built-in wall safe
