To make the pro-file editor work, you need to create a folder in the root disk: DISK/fallout2/dev/PROTO/... (instead of the ellipsis of the profile folder: CRITTERS, SCENERY, etc.)
In the Fallout 2 file system, no more than 8 characters are allowed in the file name, otherwise such a file will not be found by the engine or script. This applies to anything - sprites, sounds, scripts, location maps, etc.
