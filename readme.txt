Follow the steps of the auto-installer, if available, to install the program.


------------------------------------------------------
(3) TECHNICAL NOTES
------------------------------------------------------

1. System requirements are similar to Fallout 2.

2. "Fallout: Sonora" is not compatible with mods, add-ons, and patches for Fallout and Fallout 2 games.

3. We highly recommend playing "Fallout: Sonora" in the original screen resolution of 640x480 on monitors with a diameter of about 17 inches and an aspect ratio of 4:3. Playing in a higher resolution adversely affects the game's perception and gameplay.
