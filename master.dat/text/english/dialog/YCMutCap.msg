{100}{}{You see the commander of the Nightkin.}
{101}{}{You see a Nightkin super mutant.}
{102}{}{No thanks, human. But you've earned respect. We'll cross paths again, strange one.}
{103}{}{Gomer is so happy! So happy!}

{200}{}{Leave me, human! Wait... you're not Brotherhood, are you?}
{201}{}{Listen, no time to explain, but I want to free you. Just follow me and stay out of sight of the paladins.}
{202}{}{Sit tight, big guy, until I call you.}
{203}{}{So Gomer's with you? Strange... I've seen a lot, but this is new.}
{204}{}{I don't quite get your game, little human. But there better be no tricks.}
{205}{}{We'll talk when we get to a safe place. Let's go.}
{206}{}{Now you're free.}
{207}{}{Explain yourself, little human. What's all this? Why help a Nightkin? Who sent you?}
{208}{}{It's Gomer. He wanted to help his squad to make-up for his mistakes.}
{209}{}{Gomer? Ha! Even the dumbest can surprise you sometimes. You've caught me off guard, little human. Now I see. Gomer sees strength in you. Fine, let Gomer decide if he stays with you or with the Nightkin. While he thinks, I'll head to camp. See you, strange one.}
{210}{}{Yes, see you.}
