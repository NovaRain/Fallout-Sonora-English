{100}{}{You see the delegate.}
{101}{}{You see a person from outside the cult. Amidst the Cathedral's walls, he looks like a real savage.}

{200}{}{Hey, you. Bring me some of those fruits, I am hungry.}
{201}{}{Why would I bring you food?}
{202}{}{Oh, so you are not one of Followers? Then be gone, I care not about you. Only Church of the Holy Fire is worthy of respect. They are future of these lands; Rest are just trash.}
{203}{}{Who are you?}
{204}{}{I am elder of eastern tribe. We form alliance with Followers and want to become part of this great nation.}
{205}{}{An alliance with tribespeople? Why does the church need this?}
{206}{}{Church cares about wasteland people. Is this your first time in city? Look at how much good Church of the Holy Fire has brought to this place. The Followers conquered Sun and imprisoned it in sticks and lamps. Is this not sign of their greatness, their divine power?}
{207}{}{Do you understand anything of their teachings?}
{208}{}{Not much, to speak true. But Followers promise to teach us. They will open temple in our valley, teach us to understand language of Ancients, and even conquer Sun. Well, that is what they promise.}
{209}{}{And in return?}
{210}{}{We will become servants - title of honor for tribe! We will work for good of church, and church will help us. This way we will not only save ourselves but also become better, smarter, and stronger.}
{211}{}{I see. Bye then.}
{212}{}{You again? Go away, I will only talk to Aaron.}
