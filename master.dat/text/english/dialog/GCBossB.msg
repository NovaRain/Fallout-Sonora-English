{100}{}{You see Mr. Kogan.}
{101}{}{You see Mr. Kogan before you, still in his dirty business suit.}
{102}{}{The transaction was successful.}

{110}{}{Watch the area. We can't let anyone interfere with this deal.}
{111}{}{Deal with these idiots while I handle the caravan.}
{112}{}{Go back to the garage and we'll talk there.}
{113}{}{Get out of my sight.}
{114}{}{I'll head back to my garage, but Lucas will pay dearly for his insolence.}
{115}{}{This caravan was our only hope for a bright future...}

{120}{}{Looks clear.}
{121}{}{Damn, those are Lucas's men. Deal with them.}
{122}{}{It's done. You can go back to the garage.}

{200}{}{You don't worry me. Just leave town, and you won't get hurt.}
{201}{}{Lucas offers a deal. Give him control of the plant.}
{202}{}{Lucas has lost my trust. He robbed other scavengers and took over Trayvon's territory. Tell him if he doesn't leave my city, today will be the last day of his busy but short life.}
{203}{}{Lucas isn't going anywhere. Make your decision now.}
{204}{}{Alright, I'll tell him.}
{205}{}{Okay, get Lucas' men out before they ruin the deal. Do as I say!}
{206}{}{It seems it's starting...}
{207}{}{Only Lucas and his people can fully restore the plant. You should cooperate with him.}
{208}{}{Hmm... It's true  that Trayvon and his crew are clueless about this. They're good at scavenging ruins, but maybe the factory needs Lucas's skills.}
{209}{}{So what should I tell him?}
{210}{}{Oh no, he's not leaving empty-handed.}
{211}{}{Fine. He can restore the factory, and run it, but don't expect low taxes in MY town. I won't forget all the trouble he caused.}
{212}{}{Thanks, Mr. Kogan.}
