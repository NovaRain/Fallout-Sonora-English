{100}{}{You see the motel manager.}
{101}{}{You see a short, bald man in very worn clothes.}
{102}{}{You are well rested and energized.}

Reaction to armor
{160}{}{That's quite the outfit you have. Maybe a tad too much. Selling?}
{161}{}{It's not for sale. It's a family heirloom.}
{162}{}{(purses lips thoughtfully) Hmm. An affinity for old stuff must be in your blood.}
{163}{}{No one asked you.}
{164}{}{I don't know, these things were just inherited. That's it.}
{165}{}{(looks at the star on your new armor with contempt) So, are you one of the Rangers? And what the hell are you doing here? Gonna preach your morals and impose your gang's rules? We don't need that here. We handle our own.}
{166}{}{Hold your tongue, fool. Someday this city will kneel before the Law.}
{167}{}{I don't know what you're talking about. I just found this armor lying in the desert.}
{168}{}{Hey, are you one of those cultists from the south? I heard they wear ridiculous clothes like that and worship the nuclear bomb. If you are, I don't wanna hear about your 'faith'.}
{169}{}{May the Holy Fire give you sight, fool.}
{170}{}{You think I'm part of some cult? I don't think so!}
{171}{}{Y-you... y-you're... You're not going to sleep in that tin can, are you? And why do you need a motel with equipment like that?}
{172}{}{Get yourself some Power Armor before you try to tell me what to do.}
{173}{}{Don't worry, I won't hurt you.}
{174}{}{Hmm. I would've never thought of making armor out of road signs.}
{175}{}{Mock my armor, and you'll regret it. Got it?}
{176}{}{Me too. It's just a trophy.}

#Stop the dialogue
{180}{}{I know you caused quite a commotion at the bar. You planning to cause trouble here too?}
{181}{}{No, no, it was an accident. A local drunk just picked a fight. In real life, I'm quieter than a cob of corn!}
{182}{}{I'll "believe" you. But if you want to book a room, you'll be paying double the price.}
{183}{}{I don't give a damn about your prices.}
{184}{}{But this is a motel. If you're not going to book a room, then why are you here?}
{185}{}{I'm asking myself the same question. I guess I should go.}
{186}{}{I needed to talk to someone.}
{187}{}{Thanks for not throwing me out into the street.}
{188}{}{I can do without your prices. I'm leaving.}
{189}{}{And what if I did? Sit quietly in your chair and don't make a fuss.}
{190}{}{Okay. As you say. But if you book a room, you'll pay double the price.}
{191}{}{You're giving yourself a lot of rope, you bastard!}
{192}{}{You're in the wrong town to be making threats, bucko. Go and get some fresh air.}
{193}{}{Fuck you then!}
{194}{}{The rest of this town thinks better of me.}
{195}{}{Okay, sorry. I don't need any more trouble, understand?}
{196}{}{Of course.}
{197}{}{Ask your fellow townsfolk about me. They'll probably say something nice.}
{198}{}{I highly doubt it.}
{199}{}{Let's not fight. I am here for peaceful purposes.}

First dialogue
{200}{}{(You see a balding man in a shabby jacket; he peers at you suspiciously through the gloom of the stuffy motel lobby.)}
{201}{}{Hello.}
{202}{}{Hey hey! Those guys were just hooligans. I didn't want any problems and turned a blind eye to their antics. What was I to do? I'm also a victim of circumstances. But killing them... Let's just say I didn't see anything, and you just leave, okay?}
{203}{}{Don't worry, I won't inconvenience you anymore.}
{204}{}{Sit quietly and keep a low profile. Don't think you can get rid of me that easily.}

#Re-dialogue
{210}{}{How can I help you?}
{211}{}{Goodbye.}

{219}{}{Forget it, I don't have that many caps right now.}
{220}{}{I'm looking for a slave convoy that passed by the city. Do you know anything about this?}
{221}{}{Maybe. But my memory tends to improve with the sound of a hundred caps.}
{222}{}{This is highway robbery! I'll ask someone else.}
{223}{}{Spit it out! My patience is wearing thin!}
{224}{}{That's not very friendly of you. Every scavenger in this city knows me, and you're just a stranger from the wasteland. So get lost before I call for help.}
{225}{}{Have it your way, here's a hundred caps. Now tell me everything you know.}
{226}{}{Okay, I'll leave peacefully.}
{227}{}{Here are the caps. Now spill it.}
{228}{}{I know to be careful with these guys. Why do you ask?}
{229}{}{I'm tracking this convoy. Do you know where they went?}

{230}{}{(scrapes up the caps from the table in amazement) I didn't think you were serious... Yeah, those guys stirred up quite a ruckus in our quiet town. It's been a long time since it's been this lively. But the whole city got a good deal out of them.}
{231}{}{What kind of deal?}
{232}{}{Almost every establishment in town got something. My motel was packed, they drank almost all the booze at the bar, and Mr. Kogan seemed pleased with the deals he was setting up. The city lived off this slave deal for a week.}
{233}{}{Who are these slavers?}
{234}{}{The convoy was made up of various mercenaries, but I don't know who's behind it. Obviously, they didn't come here to do the dirty work themselves.}
{235}{}{So where did these bastards go?}
{236}{}{A town called Flagstaff. Follow Route 40 east. They say it takes about a week to get there.}
{237}{}{Damn...}
{238}{}{What did you say about deals?}
{239}{}{I guess it's time for me to hit the road.}

#Room
{250}{}{Seems like you rent out rooms overnight?}
{251}{}{Does the word "motel" not mean anything to you? Yeah, I rent rooms.}
{252}{}{Tell me about the rooms.}
{253}{}{Room for one person. Moderately reliable lock. Bedding and furniture included, but don't complain about cleanliness. At night, the corridor lights stay on. The main advantage is security. No raider can get in here easily, so you can sleep peacefully.}
{254}{}{Do you really get much business?}
{255}{}{The city used to trade actively with the southern towns, and scavengers and caravanners flocked here. Lately, there've been fewer visitors. (sigh) I'm barely scraping by.}
{256}{}{How long have you been running this motel?}
{257}{}{I came here a few years ago, like many others, hoping to earn some caps. The town needed a motel, and I thought this was a better gig than a dirty and unsafe 'mine'.}
{258}{}{I'm surprised you call it a 'motel'.}
{259}{}{I don't know. That's just how it turned out. The Old Town is full of garages and auto repair shops. Caravanners use those huge pickup truck trailers. So... motel.}
{260}{}{Okay, that was a dumb question.}
{261}{}{Tempting. I'll think about it.}
{262}{}{Enough history. Let's talk about something more pressing.}
{263}{}{Call it what you want, but right now, I'd rather change the subject.}
{264}{}{Wow, a quiet and peaceful night's sleep? That's worth a lot. How much for one night?}
{265}{}{Ah, if only you knew about the wonderful adobe houses in my village... But how much for a night in this dump?}
{266}{}{It'll cost you }
{267}{}{ caps.}
{268}{}{I want to rent a room.}
{269}{}{Here's the caps.}
{270}{}{I'll think about it.}
{271}{}{Too expensive. I'll sleep in the open air.}

{280}{}{Hey, some girl's being raped in the next room!}
{281}{}{None of your business. If you don't want trouble, walk by and keep quiet.}
{282}{}{And you're not going to do anything?}
{283}{}{So you're okay with them doing that?}
{284}{}{The girl chose this life. If she didn't want to, she wouldn't have gotten involved with those guys. Don't feel sorry for her. Nothing bad will happen. The guys will have their fun and let her go... I'm telling you, it's none of your business!}
{285}{}{Damn, I can't just leave this alone.}
{286}{}{Alright, I really should move on.}
