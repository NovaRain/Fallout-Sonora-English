{100}{}{You see a guard in front of you.}
{101}{}{You see a casino bouncer. He keeps order carefully.}
{102}{}{You see a casino bouncer. He's on the lookout for thieves.}
{103}{}{You see a casino bouncer. He's watching the front door.}
{104}{}{You see a casino bouncer. He's keeping an eye on a couple of dubious visitors.}
{105}{}{You see a casino bouncer. He looks around boredly.}
{106}{}{You see a casino bouncer with a fake stern look on his face.}
{107}{}{You see a man in a suit and with a weapon. He's definitely a guard.}

{110}{}{Put your weapon away immediately, sir.}
{111}{}{I repeat, put away your weapon.}
{112}{}{You were warned.}
{113}{}{Beyond this door are the service rooms. You can't go there.}
{114}{}{Hey, get off the stage.}
{115}{}{You'll have to put this away. The open carrying of weapons is prohibited in the casino.}

#Trying to speak

{200}{}{Not my department, sorry.}
{201}{}{You'll want to talk to the manager.}
{202}{}{I'm not supposed to chat with customers.}
{203}{}{The manager prefers we don't bother the guests.}
{204}{}{Enjoy yourself, the staff's got everything covered.}
{205}{}{You're safe here, no need to worry.}
{206}{}{This place runs clean, no funny business.}
{207}{}{We don't put up with any thieves around here.}
{208}{}{Hope you're having a good time.}
{209}{}{Tried our tequila yet? It's a hit.}
{210}{}{Give the Atomic Cocktail a go - it's got a real kick.}
{211}{}{The bar's right over there.}
{212}{}{They've got some great drinks at the bar.}
{213}{}{We don't like troublemakers, but let's just say it depends on the profit.}
{214}{}{Everything alright here?}
{215}{}{}
{216}{}{}
{217}{}{}
{218}{}{}
{219}{}{}

{250}{}{Back off, or this is gonna get ugly.}
{251}{}{You're digging yourself into a hole.}
{252}{}{Play if you want, but keep away from the guards.}
{253}{}{If you start trouble, you'll find yourself outside real quick. Got it?}
{254}{}{Better leave, you dumb peasant.}
{255}{}{I'm not here to be your décor.}
{256}{}{You sure you want to start something here? This isn't the place.}
{257}{}{With your rep, you should be running out of town.}
{258}{}{You've got some nerve, don't you?}
{259}{}{(the guard just ignores you)}

{280}{}{Uh... yeah, you're gonna have to leave the suit outside.}  
{281}{}{We can't really let you in with that... Eh, alright, go ahead.}  
{282}{}{You're not gonna cause any trouble, right?}  
{283}{}{I mean, how do you even play in *that* thing?}  
{284}{}{Nothing personal, but that kind of armor doesn't fly here.}  
{285}{}{Mind leaving your armor somewhere else, please?}  
{286}{}{Uh, right, of course... you're always welcome, sir... or ma'am...}  
{287}{}{Sorry, but you'll wreck the furniture in that. Please leave.}  
{288}{}{We can't let you roam around in... whatever that is.}  
{289}{}{You, uh, look a bit *intimidating* in that armor...}  

{290}{}{Put that weapon away, now.}  
{291}{}{I strongly suggest you holster your weapon, immediately.}  
{292}{}{We don't allow anyone flashing guns in here.}  
{293}{}{If you're itching to pull the trigger, take it outside.}  
{294}{}{This isn't a fight club, put the weapons away.}  
{295}{}{Is that a threat?}  
{296}{}{No weapons allowed in the casino, period.}  
{297}{}{Hey, put that away. We don't want any trouble here.}  
{298}{}{Holster your weapon, and no one has to get hurt.}  
{299}{}{This is a peaceful place. Don't even think about threatening anyone.}
