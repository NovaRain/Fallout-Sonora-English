{100}{}{You see your madre.}
{101}{}{You see a woman you know well, your mother.}
{102}{}{Goodbye, mother. I can take care of myself now.}
{103}{}{Your madre has returned to the Villa.}
{104}{}{Here you go! Well, get out of there! Stop scaring people.}
{105}{}{}
{106}{}{Here comes our hero. We love you.}
{1106}{}{And here comes our heroine. We love you.}
{107}{}{Please leave and don't come back. No one here wishes you harm.}
{108}{}{Be careful. We love you.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Here comes my son, the hero. The entire Villa owes you for our rescue. It was quite a feat.}
{1200}{}{And here comes my daughter, the heroine. The entire Villa owes you for our rescue. It was quite a feat.}
{201}{}{Did you have any trouble getting back?}
{202}{}{Hmm... The journey was long and hard. But we stuck together - that's what sets the people of the Villa apart from the savages.}
{203}{}{That's good.}
{204}{}{Oh my god! What have the wastelands done to you? Your skin feels... burnt! How do you feel? Can you still talk? I don't know what to think. It looks like you'll be stuck like this forever. I'm so sorry... But don't worry, we'll find a way to fix this.}
{205}{}{It's okay, I'm already starting to get used to it.}

#Second dialogue
{210}{}{Yes?}
{211}{}{Uh, nothing.}
{212}{}{Did something happen? Why aren't you sleeping?}

{220}{}{Can I ask a sensitive question?}
{221}{}{Of course, you can always speak honestly with me.}
{222}{}{Why was the rest of the world hidden from the people of the Villa? I visited some unusual places, and it was... unexpected.}
{223}{}{Well, look at the Villa. When the Founder brought people here, it was nothing but a barren wasteland. Our ancestors poured their lives into this land, just for the food on their tables. They only succeeded because they held fast to the Founder's teachings: work for the good of the community, share what you have with others, and never let outsiders in.}
{224}{}{[Listen]}
{225}{}{Tell me, are there many places outside the Villa where gardens also bloom and peace reigns? No? In that case, we have nothing to learn from the "rest of the world".}
{226}{}{But the world is changing. Don't you think Villa needs to change with it?}
{227}{}{What changes could there be? We grow the crops, we share them - it's the only way our community survives. Sure, sometimes we need things from outside, but we can always trade for them with our harvest. Don't waste time thinking about unnecessary things. The outside world's lost its way, and it's heading toward ruin. One day, it'll fall into the abyss.}
{228}{}{Hmph. I'll think about that.}
{229}{}{Alright, I got it.}
{230}{}{You know, the community intends to punish Chris for his cowardice.}
{231}{}{I tried to convince the Council to lighten the punishment, but the law's beyond me. Seems like people needed someone to take it out on, and they chose Chris. Maybe it's for the best. Either way, it's not wise to go against the will of the majority.}
{232}{}{You're pretty wise, madre. Can I ask you about something else?}

#Quests
{250}{}{What else can I do for Villa?}
{251}{}{Your padre still hasn't escaped from wherever he's being held. I'm afraid someone will have to go looking for him. And there's no one else who can do it, except you.}
{252}{}{What happened to him after he was taken to Flagstaff?}
{253}{}{He was interrogated for a long time and was then taken to a large city called Phoenix. I don't know anything other than that.}
{254}{}{I'll find him.}
{255}{}{Ask around the Villa. Everyone here needs help - in word or deed.}
{256}{}{Okay.}
{257}{}{Padre is... dead. He won't be coming home.}
{258}{}{(sighs) I can't believe it... He... he was a strong leader, the whole community relied on him... Do you know this for sure? Yes? Then we shouldn't waste time.}
{259}{}{What are you talking about?}
{260}{}{Go to the town hall. We need to gather the elders and decide what to do next. You... you are our leader now. Make your decisions carefully... I need to lie down. Don't worry about me.}
{261}{}{Okay, I'll go get the elders.}
{262}{}{Have you seen Sancho and Hugo? It looks like never got out of Flagstaff, or... they died trying to escape. They might still need your help.}
{263}{}{Okay.}
{264}{}{Alright, but let's chat a little more before I go.}
{265}{}{Can we talk a little more?}

{270}{}{The Council wants to blow up the Flagstaff mine. What do you think of this idea?}
{271}{}{Please be careful. I don't want to see you go on such a dangerous mission. But this mine needs to be stopped. Otherwise, the hands of the slavers will once again reach out for our village. And we don't have the strength to fight them.}
{272}{}{I see.}
{273}{}{The Council has decided to destroy the Garage City factory. What do you think about this?}
{274}{}{The Scavengers have already shown their true colors. They can't be trusted, and they don't care about us at all. Once they get that plant running, a flood of new workers will pour in. If we want to protect our way of life and keep the peace, we can't let that happen.}
{275}{}{I see.}
{276}{}{How do you feel about an alliance with the Rangers?}
{277}{}{We need allies, and there is no one better the Rangers. But I am afraid that they will try to interfere in our internal affairs. We can't let that happen. We should exchange food for protection from raiders. Don't let it go further than that.}
{278}{}{Hmm, I understand your concerns, madre.}
{279}{}{How do you feel about an alliance with the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{280}{}{We don't have a choice, do we? The most important thing is that we stay alive. Survive. Saving our people is our main task.}
{281}{}{Good answer, madre.}
{282}{}{I could definitely use some luck.}
{283}{}{By equipping the amulet, you have gained a permanent bonus to luck.}

{290}{}{How were you treated in Flagstaff?}
{291}{}{The jailers made me work, but they were somewhat lenient because I'm a woman. That's not the case for the men, though. They often faced extreme cruelty. Still, the jailers didn't want to lose their labor force, so they mostly resorted to intimidation instead.}
{292}{}{What about the colonists? How'd they treat you?}
{293}{}{The colonists mostly avoided talking to me. I think they're not in a very free position themselves, thanks to those high taxes. It's no surprise they even took my family pendant, the one I inherited from my grandmother. It doesn't hold any value for them, but it means everything to me.}
{294}{}{Why would someone want your pendant?}
{295}{}{Well, he said he'd get some "good caps" from the bartender for it. I doubt he got even a cap and a half.}
{296}{}{Sorry to hear that. I hope that jailer got what he deserved.}
{297}{}{It's just a family pendant. Don't let it bother you too much.}
{298}{}{I got your pendant back, madre.}
{299}{}{Oh, thank you! Honestly, it wasn't worth the risk, but you've helped preserve our family history. Here, take this pendant. It's yours now. I hope it brings you good luck on your journey.}
