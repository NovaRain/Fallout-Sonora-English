{100}{}{You see a rogue scavenger.}
{101}{}{You see one of the local scavengers. Though he looks more like a bandit.}
{102}{}{Another disgusting ghoul. I'm so sick of you freaks!}
{103}{}{Who do we have here? Ghoul lover or just a wandering scavenger? Either way, you ain't leaving...}
{104}{}{Get the hell out of here while I'm still in a good mood.}

{110}{}{We don't need any competition!}
{111}{}{Get out of our ruins!}
{112}{}{Everything in Dayglow is mine!}
{113}{}{Don't you fuckin' touch anything in these ruins without my say-so!}

{120}{}{I hate mutants!}
{121}{}{I hate ghouls!}
{122}{}{All these super mutants and ghouls are freaks of nature.}
{123}{}{Super mutants have ruined a lot of lives. They don't deserve any mercy.}
{124}{}{We got a mutant lover here? I'll waste 'em' on the spot!}
{125}{}{These ghouls are getting in the way of scavenging.}
{126}{}{Fuck the ghouls!}
{127}{}{No mercy for mutants!}
{128}{}{}
{129}{}{}

{130}{}{Hey, you filthy ghoul! How do you wanna die?}
{131}{}{You ghouls are stopping us from scavenging the ruins.}
{132}{}{To me, you're all the same. Ghouls, super mutants - same shit.}
{133}{}{Look at your disgusting mug, ghoul.}
{134}{}{Don't argue with me, freak.}
{135}{}{Speak up, you ugly freak. Where do you keep all the loot?}
{136}{}{I'm asking for the last time: where are the caps?}
{137}{}{}
{138}{}{}
{139}{}{}

{140}{}{Idiots! How could you let some stinking ghoul get away?}
{141}{}{Where's that ghoul? Where is he, damn it?!}
{142}{}{A bunch of morons, you couldn't even keep track of a ghoul!}
{143}{}{Turns out that ghoul was craftier than I thought...}
{144}{}{Looks like the ghoul wasn't alone...}
{145}{}{If that ghoul calls his buddies from San Ysidro...}
{146}{}{Damn it, that ghoul will tell everyone we're here.}
{147}{}{We need to get out of here before that ghoul tells the others.}
{148}{}{The little rotten bastard escaped right from under our noses...}
{149}{}{We gotta split. Everyone's got an hour to pack up!}
