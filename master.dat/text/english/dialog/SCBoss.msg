{100}{}{You see General Dixon.}
{101}{}{You see the General himself - an incredibly vain and assertive warrior.}
{102}{}{I'm not in the mood to talk right now.}
{103}{}{?}
{104}{}{What are you doing?! Any Power Armor is the property of the Brotherhood of Steel. Return it to the quartermaster immediately.}
{105}{}{Thanks for your help with the Rangers. But I have a lot to do now. Contact someone below.}
{106}{}{You have officially relinquished your Ranger badge.}
{107}{}{You have officially joined the Order of the Brotherhood of Steel.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{A civilian? What are you doing here?}
{201}{}{I... uh...}
{202}{}{I'm here to destroy your ship, idiot.}
{203}{}{Intruder on the ship! Combat alert, everyone!}
{204}{}{Damn...}
{205}{}{This won't save you...}

{208}{}{Smart call, «my dear friend». But even with your community's consent, there's still one thorn in my side - the Rangers. They fancy themselves noble guardians, but in truth, they're little more than a self-important blockade standing in the way of our progress north. We've been scouting their positions around Phoenix, and once we're ready, we'll deal with those bastards properly.}  #added for espanol trait - cambraagol
{209}{}{What in the blazes is this? Which idiot let a MUTANT on board?! Someone's getting a proper dressing-down for this! Alright, you green freak, you better have a damn good reason for being here. Well?}
{210}{}{What in the blazes is this? Someone's getting a proper dressing-down for letting a civilian waltz in here like they own the place. Fine. You're here now - so talk. Who are you, and what exactly do you want from me?}  
{211}{}{I'm here to wipe out your army of invading scum from the face of the earth. Death to the invaders!}
{212}{}{Permission to go, General.}
{213}{}{Ulysses Grant sent you a report.}
{214}{}{Ah, finally. They say the news from Phoenix should make me happy. But let me be perfectly clear, courier - if you've brought me half-measures and excuses, you won't leave here in one piece.}  
{215}{}{That's right, General.}
{216}{}{I'll try, General.}
{217}{}{Interesting. Why did Ulysses send *you*? This isn't a job he'd give to some drifter with a lucky streak. No, he'd only trust someone with... deeper connections. So tell me - who are you really, and what's your business with the cultists in Phoenix?}  
{218}{}{I have a long history, General. I'm from a village in the north. You've probably never heard of it.}
{219}{}{Village? So are you growing anything? Or do you hunt and gather?}
{220}{}{We manage the land and mostly grow corn. But recently, we were raided by slavers from Flagstaff...}
{221}{}{Ah, that's it. I have already been informed about the labor shortage in the uranium mine. Well, the situation was inevitable. It's damn unfair, son.}
{1221}{}{Ah, that's it. I have already been informed about the labor shortage in the uranium mine. Well, the situation was inevitable. It's damn unfair, lady.}
{222}{}{That's right, General. Terribly unfair.}
{223}{}{I was sent by Hard from Two-Sun. Here is his recommendation.}
{224}{}{Hard must have had a damn good reason for vouching for you. I've heard things are shifting in Two-Sun - enough to make even the locals nervous. But that doesn't answer my question: who the hell are you, and how exactly did you earn the trust of the Tinsmiths?}  
{1224}{}{Hard must have had a damn good reason for vouching for you. I've heard things are shifting in Two-Sun - enough to make even the locals nervous. But that doesn't answer my question: who the hell are you, and how exactly did you earn the trust of the Tinsmiths?}
{225}{}{The Rangers sent me. They want to stop you, but I'm interested in hearing both sides.}
{226}{}{Heh, so the Rangers have been sniffing around, have they? Got to admire the guts it took to come here and tell me that to my face. Now spill it - what promises did those self-righteous bastards dangle to get you to play messenger?}  
{227}{}{Actually, they promised freedom and protection for my home village.}
{228}{}{I'm here because you're responsible for the troubles in my village. Because of your thirst for energy, Flagstaff is raiding and enslaving villages like ours.}
{229}{}{I demand freedom and independence for my home village.}
{230}{}{So, you dream of freedom for your little village, huh? A place where raiders don't hound your people, and the corn sprouts without a drop of blood or sweat watering it?}  
{231}{}{Is this possible, General?}
{232}{}{Of course, General.}
{233}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel knows what justice really means. We're the only ones still holding onto the wisdom of the Old World - while the rest of you stumble through the ruins, playing at survival.}  
{234}{}{I think I can see that.}
{235}{}{Justice? Really?}
{236}{}{If it's freedom your village craves, then pledge yourselves to the Brotherhood. We'll shield your Villa from enemies and outfit you with technology. All we ask in return is a modest share of the harvest. And with us watching your backs, not a soul in Arizona will dare lay a hand on your precious freedom.}  
{237}{}{But we know almost nothing about your Brotherhood.}
{238}{}{That's quite the pitch, General. What kind of Brotherhood are you, anyway?}  
{239}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel is an ancient order. We're the inheritors of everything that mattered before the bombs fell - knowledge, power, technology. While the wasteland was still chewing on its own leg, we were gathering strength and waiting for the right moment to expand outward, and effect change. That moment is now. The scribes will fill you in on the finer points, if you can keep up.}  
{240}{}{.......}
{241}{}{I was just wandering by and wondered if you have any jobs?}
{242}{}{I don't waste my time with mercenaries. That's what the hiring post outside the gate is for. Now, unless you've got business that concerns me directly, I suggest you leave this fortress immediately.}  
{243}{}{Sorry, General...}
{244}{}{Okay, I'll leave peacefully.}
{245}{}{How are you going to 'change' the wasteland?}
{246}{}{So you're expanding... to what end?}
{247}{}{The wasteland doesn't need saving - it needs correcting. It has no choice but to evolve, and we're here to give it that nudge forward. Not because we want to, but because it *needs* us to. Let me guess - back in your village, folks still use bare hands for most of their work, don't they?}  
{248}{}{[Nod]}
{249}{}{Picture it - water pumps humming, generators powering your homes, and tools that do half the work for you. Medicine to heal your sick and weapons to keep raiders at bay. That's the kind of future the Brotherhood can offer your village. All you have to do is take it.}  
{250}{}{Come on. You'll simply occupy us and force us to work for the good of the Brotherhood. Not our own benefit. That isn't freedom.}
{251}{}{I've had enough of this nonsense. Your village *will* provide food and resources - whether it's by agreement or by force is entirely up to you. I offered you the easy way, but it seems you've chosen to complicate things. Now, put down your weapons and raise your hands before I change my mind.}  
{252}{}{Maybe you should raise your hands...}
{253}{}{The hell with you. You won't enslave free people.}
{254}{}{Sounds... amazing. I'm sure I could convince my kin of the advantages of joining with you.}
{255}{}{Smart call, mi querido amigo. But even with your community's consent, there's still one thorn in my side - the Rangers. They fancy themselves noble guardians, but in truth, they're little more than a self-important blockade standing in the way of our progress north. We've been scouting their positions around Phoenix, and once we're ready, we'll deal with those bastards properly.}  
{1255}{}{Smart call, mi querida amiga. But even with your community's consent, there's still one thorn in my side - the Rangers.

We've been scouting their positions around Phoenix, and once we're ready, we'll deal with those bastards properly.}  
{256}{}{Then they need to be eliminated. Their lands nearly surround Villa.}
{257}{}{Ah, a man after my own heart. Yes, the Rangers have holed up in an old dam - thinking it's an impenetrable fortress. But they've overlooked one simple truth: it only takes one crack to bring down an entire dam. Go scout the area. When the time's right, we'll take it out.}  
{258}{}{It will be done, General!}
{259}{}{As you say, General Dixon.}

{260}{}{So, we meet at last, you damn bastard. I knew you'd crawl in here sooner or later. Arizona's been itching for your head.}  
{1260}{}{So we meet, you dirty little bitch. I knew you'd crawl in here sooner or later. Arizona's been itching for your head.}  
{261}{}{So we meet, you goddamn savage. I knew this day would come. All of Arizona's buzzing about you, like a pack of hungry flies.}  
{1261}{}{So we meet, you dirty little bitch. I knew this day would come. All of Arizona's buzzing about you, like a pack of hungry flies.}  
{262}{}{How do you know about me?}
{263}{}{Foolish peasant. Did you really think your little stunts would fly under the radar? We've got ears in every dust-ridden corner of the wasteland. Nothing important slips by us.}  
{1263}{}{Foolish little peasant. Did you really think your little stunts would fly under the radar? We've got ears in every dust-ridden corner of the wasteland. Nothing important slips by us.}  
{264}{}{So what do you think about my 'stunts', General?}
{265}{}{I don't care what you think you know or have heard. I'm here to finish you and your entire 'brotherhood'.}
{266}{}{You ignorant peasant. Do you have the faintest idea how much work went into creating the Church of the Holy Fire in Phoenix? All that thankless effort, aimed at pulling the city - and the region - back from the brink. And now the whole operation's gone up in nuclear flames, thanks to a few stubborn, dirty peasants. It's a damned tragedy for Arizona and a disaster for its future.}  
{267}{}{Continue.}
{268}{}{Do you know how much diplomatic work went into forging our alliance with the Tinsmiths? We performed miracles to secure those trade routes. Now, thanks to your meddling, Two-Sun will wither like a plant with no water.}  
{269}{}{Continue.}
{270}{}{Flagstaff's mine wasn't just some hole in the ground - it was the linchpin for restarting civilization. Uranium ore means power, and power is the foundation for all progress in Arizona. Without it, everything grinds to a halt. Do you even grasp the scale of what you've sabotaged?}  
{271}{}{Continue.}
{272}{}{.....}
{273}{}{Continue.}
{274}{}{Now tell me - what exactly are you trying to accomplish, you meddling son of a bitch?}  
{1274}{}{Now tell me - what exactly are you trying to accomplish, you interfering little whore?}  
{275}{}{Because of all your plans, your projects, your meddling, my family, my kin, face a difficult, and uncertain future. I am seeking freedom for my Villa.}
{276}{}{Maybe - just maybe - I could've mustered a shred of compassion, found a middle ground. But all the grand work of restoring social, economic, and technological order across this entire region? Down a mole rat's burrow, all because of one filthy, defiant village. Unbelievable.}  
{277}{}{That's right. You won't take our freedom. What's the matter, General? Something not sitting right with you?}  
{278}{}{You're committing crimes against people under the guise of 'noble goals'. You didn't even ask whether we wanted your grand vision.}
{279}{}{If housewives had ordered politics before the War, the world wouldn't have been able to survive a day!}
{280}{}{Nonsense. Housewives don't want the world to burn. But thanks to your meddling, Dixon, all of Arizona is going up in flames.}  
{281}{}{You may be right about that, General.}
{282}{}{Well, for all your annoying antics, one has to give you some credit. I never expected that one hayseed would be able to pull off such a complex task. But you know, I'm ready to forgive you for *your* meddling.}
{283}{}{Really?}
{284}{}{Oh, how "noble" of you.}
{285}{}{Your rebellious little village can earn forgiveness - and protection - under the Brotherhood's banner. But there's a catch. To secure that future, our competition - the Rangers - needs to be removed from the equation. My scouts tell me they've holed up in an old hydroelectric dam. Scout the area and find a way to make that dam disappear.}  
{286}{}{The hell with this. The Rangers will protect us, and you'll go to hell.}
{287}{}{Too bad. So, in accordance with the laws of the Old World, you'll face the death penalty for your crimes against us. Prepare to accept your fate, you piece of shit...}
{288}{}{Go to hell.}
{289}{}{But I've committed no crimes...}
{1289}{}{But I've committed no crimes...}
{290}{}{If you leave us alone, I'll try it.}
{291}{}{As Supreme Paladin, I *will* keep my word. Take action.}
{292}{}{Alright. Goodbye.}
{293}{}{It's strange to hear you saying its unfair, when you're the one behind it all.}
{294}{}{What the hell are you going on about? We're just buying nuclear batteries - ones the Tinsmiths of Two-Sun make. Sure, they get their uranium from Flagstaff, but that's their problem, not ours. I've heard their leadership got greedy, but what can we do about it? We need those batteries, and the whole region depends on them.}  
{295}{}{Right. But *you* keep them all in business. Isn't that the fact of the matter?}
{296}{}{Listen, son, we're not slave traders. The Brotherhood is an ancient and noble order. Our purpose is to maintain order in the wasteland - because right now, California's a damned mess. There's a war with an army of super mutants out there. If we fail to stop it, that menace will march right to your doorstep. Is that what you want?}  
{1296}{}{Listen, lady, we're not slave traders. The Brotherhood is an ancient and noble order. Our purpose is to maintain order in the wasteland - because right now, California's a damned mess. There's a war with an army of super mutants out there. If we fail to stop it, that menace will march right to your doorstep. Is that what you want?}  
{297}{}{Well, no, of course not.}
{298}{}{Stop with all this crap. It's all just lies. The real threat is right in front of me!}
{299}{}{}

#Re-dialogue
{300}{}{Report.}
{301}{}{Permission to leave, General.}
{302}{}{What the hell do you want, mutant?}
{303}{}{You've got nerve, showing your face around here, damn mutant!}
{304}{}{You're the only mutant I can tolerate on my ship. So, what do you want from me?}

{310}{}{I have a message for you from Ulysses Grant.}
{311}{}{I've been waiting for this report. Step forward.}
{312}{}{Here it is.}
{313}{}{The holodisk got ruined on the way. My apologies, General.}
{314}{}{}
{315}{}{Why don't you wear a sign that says "Brainless Fool"? I don't care how - just get me that report, now!}  
{1315}{}{Why don't you wear a sign that says "Brainless Fool"? I don't care how - just get me that report, now!}  
{316}{}{Yes, General.}
{317}{}{Just kidding, General. The holodisk is intact.}
{318}{}{You think this is a joke? I run an army, not a circus. You better pray that report doesn't implicate you. Now, hand it over.}  
{319}{}{Here it is, General.}
{320}{}{Not so fast. I was promised a reward for this job.}
{321}{}{Your job is to follow orders and keep your mouth shut. Now, where's the report?}  
{322}{}{Yes... Hmm. Interesting. Good news, too. I see Ulysses mentioned your services to the Council. He's not the kind to throw praise lightly. Must mean you're useful.}  
{323}{}{Well, my task is complete. Time for me to go.}
{324}{}{The desert journey must've been tough. Don't worry, you'll be compensated. See the quartermaster for your reward.}
{325}{}{Thank you, General.}
{326}{}{Just curious - what's in the report?}
{327}{}{It's not wise to dig too deep into such matters. But judging by the report, you already know most of it.}
{328}{}{I suppose.}
{329}{}{Just doing my job. So, about that payment?}
{330}{}{You just want caps, huh? What a shame you don't value honor and justice. But fine - you do your job well, and we respect that here. Go to the quartermaster for your payment.}  
{331}{}{Thank you, General.}

#Questions about BS
{350}{}{Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{351}{}{You're talking to the General, goddamn it. I don't have time for explanations.}
{352}{}{}
{353}{}{Okay, I'll ask someone else.}
{354}{}{General Dixon, can you clarify the Brotherhood's mission?}
{355}{}{We are a closed organization from California with a military charter and a long history.}
{356}{}{You don't seem very closed off.}
{357}{}{We used to stay hidden in a bunker deep underground, only coming up when absolutely necessary. It took rare heroes to even set foot inside. We didn't meddle in petty politics - just traded and kept order where we could.}
{358}{}{Go on.}
{359}{}{That must have been incredibly dull.}
{360}{}{After certain events you likely don't know about, the elders decided to leave the bunker and explore neighboring lands.}
{361}{}{That clears it up a bit. But you know, I have a few more questions about the Brotherhood.}
{362}{}{And you're glad to be out of the bunker, aren't you? The Brotherhood needs some fresh air.}
{363}{}{Thanks for your time. I won't keep you any longer.}
{364}{}{Why are you stationed at this port?}
{365}{}{This port is prime real estate for building an impenetrable fortress. And our destroyer's reactor? Best damn thing running in this wasteland.}
{366}{}{I see. Can you answer another question about the Brotherhood?}

{367}{}{Why are you interfering in this region's affairs?}
{368}{}{We need resources. And getting them means labor and infrastructure - neither of which exist here. So, we teach the locals how to work right.}
{369}{}{Is there any other reason?}
{370}{}{Take a look at your tribes - squabbling over scraps and spilling blood over water rations. Phoenix stands as a beacon of progress, but it's surrounded by settlements that hate each other's guts. What Arizona needs is a force to pull it together and restart civilization.}
{371}{}{[More]}
{372}{}{Is there such a force here? Hell no. That's why we're here. Yeah, we've got our interests - pre-war tech and knowledge. But tell me, what good is that to savages who'd waste it?}
{373}{}{[More]}
{374}{}{We drag these tribes kicking and screaming toward progress. They get valuable knowledge: economics, currency, medicine - and the first school in generations. Arizona owes us for its new achievements, whether they want to admit it or not.}
{375}{}{I take it these are your words, Dixon. Does the headquarters know what's going on?}
{376}{}{This fort operates somewhat independently from headquarters' decisions. I've been given "broad powers" to complete our mission.}
{377}{}{I see. Can you answer another question about the Brotherhood?}

{380}{}{What are your overall goals?}
{381}{}{Our goals? That's the million-cap question. The scribes have been arguing about it for decades. Some want to rebuild civilization in the Old World's image. Others think the world doesn't deserve that kind of knowledge anymore.}
{382}{}{[More]}
{383}{}{When we first rolled into Arizona, command didn't plan on influencing things here. We were just supposed to restock nuclear reserves and jump-start a few workshops to help with the mutant war. But... things got complicated.}
{384}{}{What do you mean?}
{385}{}{You can't just scavenge batteries from a scrapyard and expect things to run. We need workers, caravans - even postal routes. We've built infrastructure and an economy from scratch. None of that existed until *we* marched into these wild lands.}
{386}{}{I see. Can you answer another question about the Brotherhood?}
{387}{}{Tell me about California.}
{388}{}{California has been ravaged by war and time. Los Angeles lies in ruins. But civilization is slowly rising from the ashes.}

{400}{}{I need to talk to you about the Rangers.}
{401}{}{These Ranger bastards always stand in our way. Did you uncover any weaknesses in their defenses?}
{402}{}{No, sir. They're too well-organized.}
{403}{}{Can't expect much from a peasant, but I trust you'll get it done. Keep me updated.}
{1403}{}{Can't expect much from a simple peasant woman, but I trust you'll get it done. Keep me updated.}
{404}{}{Permission to leave, General.}
{405}{}{Why do the Rangers bother you? Don't they uphold the law like you?}
{406}{}{First, they see us merely as invaders, and turn the locals against us, disrupting our plans. Second, they sabotage progress, attacking caravans and work camps. Finally, they control vast lands and tax the population. Who do they think they are?!}
{407}{}{Maybe they have a point?}
{408}{}{Remind you of someone, perhaps?}
{409}{}{Ahem... They prevent us from linking California and Arizona. Plus, they showed their treachery at the Battle of Nogales, trying to drive us out. That's more than enough.}
{410}{}{I'll take my leave, General.}
{411}{}{I managed to blow up the Ranger Dam.}
{412}{}{Got word of that. Hell of a job. With your help, we'll boot these meddling bandits from Arizona and restore proper order - just like the old days.}
{413}{}{What about our agreement?}
{414}{}{As promised, the Villa is now under Brotherhood protection. We'll send an envoy to formalize the alliance.}
{415}{}{That's good news.}
{416}{}{For your outstanding service to the Brotherhood, I'm offering you something no civilian's ever gotten: Brotherhood membership. Think it over. You've earned it. Dismissed.}
{417}{}{Thank you, General Dixon.}

{420}{}{I want to join the Brotherhood.}
{421}{}{Kneel and state your name.}
{422}{}{I am }
{423}{}{ from Villa. I pledge allegiance to the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{424}{}{Choose your unit.}
{425}{}{I want to be a scribe and carry the wisdom of the Old World.}
{426}{}{I want to be a paladin and bring death to the Brotherhood's enemies.}
{427}{}{I want to be a knight and spread the light of technology.}
{428}{}{I want to be a scout, where I'll be of the greatest benefit.}
{429}{}{So be it. }
{430}{}{ from Villa. Henceforth, you are an honorary member of the Brotherhood of Steel. Do not disgrace our name, honor our laws, and be faithful to the order, until death.}
{431}{}{I swear allegiance!}
{432}{}{Though I promised you a rank, my brothers have doubts about you. You'll have to prove yourself again.}
{433}{}{Damn. Reputation is tricky...}
{434}{}{Becoming one of us takes exceptional merit. Your achievements just don't measure up yet.}
{435}{}{I'll try my best from here on.}
{436}{}{Alright. You'll hear more later, General.}
{437}{}{Your service to the Brotherhood has been invaluable. I'm prepared to welcome you into our order.}
{438}{}{[More]}
{439}{}{Sorry, but we don't admit mutants into our ranks, no matter their merits. You're tolerated on the ship, but no more than that. This rule is above me.}
{1439}{}{Sorry, but we don't admit mutants into our ranks, no matter their merits. You're tolerated on the ship, but no more than that. This rule is above me.}
{440}{}{Alright. No problem, General. Take care.}
{441}{}{I dont want to join your little group anyway. Adios.}
{1441}{}{I dont want to join your little group anyway. Adios.}
