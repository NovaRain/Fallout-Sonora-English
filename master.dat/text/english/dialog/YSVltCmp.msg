{212}{}{February 2131}
{213}{}{"Recon data from recent field groups has been collected."}
{214}{}{"Alpha Group, deployed to downtown San Diego, remains unaccounted for. Their last report indicated high radiation and severe urban destruction."}
{215}{}{"Beta Group, tasked with recon along the piers, returned prematurely, unable to complete their route. They report high radiation and heavy structural damage throughout. All bridges to Coronado Island are down, and military and civilian ships at the piers are either sunk or irreparably damaged. Numerous active robots, likely from a naval base, were observed along the shoreline. The team members are showing signs of radiation sickness."}
{216}{}{"Gamma Group, exploring the southern sectors, brought back a modest supply of useful items and pre-war rations. They observed moderate structural damage and elevated radiation."}
{217}{}{"Delta Group, scouting the eastern regions, reports lower radiation levels farther inland with only minor structural damage. They encountered unusual fauna, showing irregular forms and sizes. Part of the team was lost."}
{218}{}{"None of the groups have detected any living inhabitants or recent signs of human activity."}
{219}{}{Return to main menu}
{220}{}{April 2131}
{221}{}{"Zeta Group has returned from the West-Tek research site. Only one member survived. The survivor reports extreme radiation levels and devastation across the complex. Security bots and unidentified creatures were sighted around the perimeter."}
{222}{}{"Medical examination indicates the scout has severe radiation poisoning and unknown mutations. They are not expected to survive. Further recon of the West-Tek site is advised against."}
{223}{}{May 2132}
{224}{}{"Epsilon Group has returned from Los Angeles. The team reports several small settlements and camps, the largest being Adytum, populated by nuclear war survivors across Southern California. These communities sustain themselves by salvaging and trading pre-war resources."}
{225}{}{"The team also suggests a possible large city to the north, called the Hub, though information is sparse."}
{226}{}{"Scout reactions to local populations are mixed. Some teams perceive the locals as wary of outsiders, while others sense a willingness to integrate into a single settlement. Many scouts appear to be experiencing cultural disorientation."}
