{100}{}{You see Graham.}
{101}{}{You see one of the knights of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{102}{}{Halt. Show me your pass.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Alright, wastelander. Just 'cause you have a pass doesn't mean you can roam around distracting us from our duties. Keep to your business.}
{1200}{}{Alright, wastelander. Just 'cause you have a pass doesn't mean you can roam around distracting us from our duties. Keep to your business.}
{201}{}{Sorry, I was just incredibly curious. This place is so... unique.}
{202}{}{Impressive, isn't it? A real ship, fully equipped with a disciplined crew and enough firepower to level a town. So, tell me, wastelander - ever seen anything close to this? Didn't think so.}
{1202}{}{Impressive, isn't it? A real ship, fully equipped with a disciplined crew and enough firepower to level a town. So, tell me, wastelander - ever seen anything close to this? Didn't think so.}
{203}{}{Distract you from duties? You're just lounging in the dining room doing nothing.}
{204}{}{This whole operation runs smoothly because we do our jobs right. And you? You wouldn't even grasp the scale of this tech if I spelled it out for you. Go on, tell me, wastelander, seen anything this advanced? Didn't think so.}
{1204}{}{This whole operation runs smoothly because we do our jobs right. And you? You wouldn't even grasp the scale of this tech if I spelled it out for you. Go on, tell me, wastelander, seen anything this advanced? Didn't think so.}
{205}{}{By the way, who are you?}
{206}{}{I'm Knight Graham. I'm responsible for the ship's equipment. Taking a quick break now, so if you've got questions, go ahead.}
{207}{}{Nice to meet you, Knight Graham.}
{208}{}{Alright then.}
{209}{}{Now I know who's to blame for the mess on this ship.}
{210}{}{Ah, our new star. Just a fresh face from the desert who thinks they're the Brotherhood's next big thing. Not bad, but don't think you'll be getting a free ride here.}
{211}{}{I get it. I'll do whatever it takes to prove my worth to the Brotherhood.}
{212}{}{Good. Just remember - Brotherhood loyalty isn't something you break. Plenty have tried, and none of them got away with it.}
{213}{}{I don't care what you or others think. I earned my place. If anyone doesn't like it, they can go to hell.}
{214}{}{Noted. You've got a tough streak - let's see if it holds up when things get real.}

#Re-dialogue
{220}{}{Alright, wastelander. You're not just here for a free meal, are you? Or maybe looking for some veteran advice? Out with it - what do you need?}
{1220}{}{Alright, wastelander. You're not just here for a free meal, are you? Or maybe looking for some veteran advice? Out with it - what do you need?}
{221}{}{Hey, soldier. Looking to fill the empty hours with food, or chat with a veteran about the service?}
{222}{}{Neither. Just getting ready to head out.}
{223}{}{Alright. But if you're looking for a bit of guidance, I'll be around.}
{224}{}{Goodbye, Knight Graham.}

{230}{}{I need some food.}
{231}{}{The cook's over there in the kitchen. Be polite if you want extra.}
{232}{}{Actually, I wanted to chat.}
{233}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}
{234}{}{Actually, I wanted to chat.}
{235}{}{Chat? Alright, what's on your mind? A lot's happened lately, could start just about anywhere.}
{236}{}{Thanks for the chat. Goodbye, Knight Graham.}

#Gambling
{250}{}{Fancy a game of cards?}
{251}{}{Cards are no fun without stakes. You got caps? I'll put down 5mm rounds. Bet's 10 rounds for 25 caps.}
{252}{}{Not today.}
{253}{}{Alright, I'm in. Let's play.}
{254}{}{No, I want an MRE.}
{255}{}{For a drifter, that's a tall order. But alright, put down 50 caps, and we'll play.}
{256}{}{}
{257}{}{Think I'm here to play games on duty? Keep in mind where you are.}
{258}{}{Yeah, sorry Knight Graham.}
{259}{}{Yeesh, I was only asking.}
{260}{}{Alright, let's start... Deal... For you... For me... Your turn.}
{261}{}{Keep it coming...}
{262}{}{I fold.}
{263}{}{What? Lost to some wastelander? Just my luck today...}
{1263}{}{What? Lost to a girl from the wasteland? Just my luck today...}
{264}{}{Your card is marked, Knight Graham.}
{265}{}{I guess that takes you down a peg. Bye, loser.}
{266}{}{Even in gambling, the Brotherhood has the upper hand. Proof positive.}
{267}{}{I'll get even next time, Knight Graham.}
{268}{}{You may have won the game, but you'll still lose the war.}

{270}{}{Up for another round of cards?}
{271}{}{If I keep losing my stash, I'll be down to rags. Call it here - Knight's orders.}
{272}{}{Okay, whatever you say...}

#Questions
{280}{}{Who's that little guy running around the upper deck?}
{281}{}{Oh, that's Young. Son of one of our paladins. Don't mind him. We're not thrilled about having powder monkeys around.}
{282}{}{I see. Let's forget about Young for now.}
{283}{}{What's wrong with having a kid on a ship?}
{284}{}{For starters, this is a military base, or more precisely an outpost. Not a place for family matters.}
{285}{}{Father's a paladin, huh? Who's the mother?}
{286}{}{That's not your business. Got it? Stay focused on what's in front of you.}
{287}{}{What's a "powder monkey"?}
{288}{}{Old term, really. Don't think about it.}

{290}{}{Tell me about your Brotherhood.}
{291}{}{Hah, what could a wastelander like you possibly need to know about us? Just understand this - there's no greater force in the Wasteland than the Brotherhood.}
{292}{}{I believe it. I wanted to ask you about something else.}
{293}{}{Sounds impressive, but I don't hear much about you in Arizona.}
{294}{}{Well, back in California, they know us. We're the ones who took down the Master and his whole mutant army. Can't believe you haven't heard of it. Makes me wonder what this world's coming to.}
{295}{}{I won't argue that. Have you guys ever taken on a real foe though?}
{296}{}{We're new here in Arizona, still getting established. The locals don't know us much yet, but back home? Every scavenger and raider knows we crushed the Master's army.}
{297}{}{That's why I'm here - to stand with the Brotherhood. But what's the story behind your glory?}
{298}{}{We've had plenty of victories lately. Heard of the Master? Stories of that war must've reached Arizona.}
{299}{}{What kind of Master?}
{300}{}{Hmm... I'd like to hear this story.}
{301}{}{Well, now that you started, you'd better finish.}
{302}{}{The Master was a damn lunatic who thought dipping everyone in goo and changing them into mutants would save humanity.}
{303}{}{Go on.}
{304}{}{Hmph, that's not a bad idea.}
{305}{}{He built up a whole cult and an army of super mutants. No one in the Wasteland could match his power - no one but us.}
{306}{}{So what did you do?}
{307}{}{You didn't like competition, did you?}
{308}{}{That was a year of hard battles and bloody victories. We took down his army and blasted him to dust. The remnants of his forces are scattered, no longer a threat.}
{309}{}{Did you fight in this war?}
{310}{}{Cool. I'd like to have seen those battles.}
{311}{}{Oh, every knight and paladin here has a story from those days. I myself held the line at Dayglow. It was one hell of a fight.}
{312}{}{Sounds a little embellished to me.}
{313}{}{The Brotherhood doesn't embellish. Talk to any knight - they'll tell you the same. I held the line at Dayglow.}
{314}{}{Can you tell me how it was?}
{315}{}{You guys seem unstoppable.}
{316}{}{After their defeat, the super mutants scattered in all directions. The largest groups hit small settlements as they fled. Junktown, Necropolis, Dayglow, even the Hub were attacked. We tried to assist where we could; we were getting calls from all over the area.}
{317}{}{It's pretty cool that you tried to help everyone.}
{318}{}{Yeah. You just helped everyone out of the kindness of your hearts.}
{319}{}{Our intel said they had a stronghold at Dayglow. We were sent to clear it, but it wasn't simple. They'd fortified their position with mines and trenches. The locals wanted them gone, but weren't too fond of us, either.}
{320}{}{Go on.}
{321}{}{Of course. Who'd want to be caught between two armies?}
{322}{}{The siege lasted two weeks. No backup, so we handled it ourselves. We gassed them, flooded their trenches with toxic waste, even used local thugs to stir up chaos. Wore them down, one by one.}
{323}{}{You starved them out?}
{324}{}{So this is 'holding the line', in your opinion?}
{325}{}{By the end of it, the super mutants were desperate. Some surrendered, others tried to escape. Our commander's tactics saved us from a full assault. If we'd charged that fort head-on, I wouldn't be here telling you this.}
{326}{}{I guess you guys really are stronger than anyone out there these days.}
{327}{}{Sounds like you guys really know how to fight.}
{328}{}{Conducting a siege isn't exactly impressive.}
{329}{}{Don't worry. Arizona will be better off with us around. Just give it time.}
{1329}{}{Don't worry, lady. Arizona will be better off with us around. Just give it time.}
{330}{}{Oh, great. Great. Uh, bye.}
{331}{}{I'm pretty sure you will, after everything I've just heard. Thanks for the story.}
{332}{}{I'm not sure an army like yours is the best thing for Arizona. Good luck out there, soldier.}

{340}{}{Do you know what happened to Paladin Bell?}
{341}{}{What's it to you? You don't even know him. Bell and I fought side by side. Best leave his name out of your mouth.}
{1341}{}{What's it to you? You don't even know him. Bell and I fought side by side. Best leave his name out of your mouth.}
{342}{}{I'm trying to heal him. And for that, I need details.}
{343}{}{It was during battles with you that his mind was broken, wasn't it?}
{344}{}{Listen, we were in different patrols. He started slipping after he got here, so who knows what caused it.}
{345}{}{He mentioned some ashen wasteland in hell. What do you think that means?}
{346}{}{Ashen wasteland? Beats me... Could be the concrete plant near Casa Nueva - place is all gray from the dust.}
{347}{}{Did he have a mission there?}
{348}{}{Well... off the record, people started disappearing at that plant. We were sent to check it out.}
{349}{}{Go on.}
{350}{}{What we found were the remains of people, torn apart. We never saw the killer. Bell was with us - that's when we first noticed he wasn't himself.}
{351}{}{So, the concrete plant in Casa Nueva. I'll have to check it out. Thanks.}
{352}{}{Battles with me... Ah, whatever. Listen, we were in different patrol units. He lost his mind after coming here, so he could've gotten his trauma anywhere.}
