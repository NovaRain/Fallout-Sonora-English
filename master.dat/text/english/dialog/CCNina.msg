{203}{}{Hello. Who are you? What is your name?}
{204}{}{Mi nombre es Lucia.}
{205}{}{Lucia, then. What a special outfit! Is this holiday really in your honor?}
{206}{}{Hoy seré reina. Este es un gran honor para mí... (hides her excited gaze) Dime sinceramente, ¿te gusta nuestra ciudad?}
{207}{}{I don't understand, are you happy or crying?}
{208}{}{(covers face) Estoy bien.}
{209}{}{Okay, I'll go on having fun.}
{210}{}{«Hello. I also speak Spanish. Can I talk to you?»}
{211}{}{«My name is Lucia.»}
{212}{}{«You seem so shy, yet your outfit is quite impressive. Is this holiday really in your honor?»}
{213}{}{«Today I'll become a queen. This is our tradition. And this is a great honor for me...» (hides her excited gaze) «Tell me, do you like our city and this holiday?»}
{214}{}{«This is the most beautiful and friendly place I've ever been to!»}
{1214}{}{«This is the most beautiful and friendly place I've ever been to!»}
{215}{}{«Really? Oh, I'm so glad. I'll do everything to keep it that way.»}
{216}{}{«Of course, you're the queen... But... I don't understand, are you happy or crying?»}
{217}{}{(covers face) «I'm fine... Please talk to someone else.»}
{218}{}{«Okay, I'll get back to the fun.»}
{219}{}{«There is nothing better than my own beautiful Villa. You have no idea how much better it is.»}
{220}{}{«Really? Ah, I'd like to see it. But I will never leave my home.»}
{221}{}{«I don't understand, are you laughing at me or crying?»}
{222}{}{«Do you know where your crown might have gone?»}
{223}{}{«Is it missing? Oh, this is bad... find it, please! I must go through the ceremony, otherwise the saint will be angry!»}
{224}{}{«Okay, okay. I'll try to talk to someone else. Maybe someone saw something.»}

{233}{}{(She lowers her head to her knees)}
{234}{}{«Are you okay?»}
{235}{}{(pulls her hand back and pushes you away) ¡Vete, gringo! ¡El Diablo ya está aquí!}
{236}{}{El Diablo? Who is this? What are you even talking about? I don't understand...}
{237}{}{El Diablo is dead. Understand? (gestures emphatically) Dead!}
{238}{}{(raises her eyes in amazement) ¿Está muerto el Diablo?... No... No! No! No! (runs away from the church)}
