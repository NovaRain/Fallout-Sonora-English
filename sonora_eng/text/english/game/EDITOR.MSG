# Description of karmic titles
#

#--- General
{1100}{}{This is a ranged stat that represents your general reputation. The higher the number, the better known and respected you are. If your rep is negative, you are hated by some for your evil actions.}
{1101}{}{You have killed a large number of people. This is generally not a good thing to get known for. People from the wrong side of the track will like you a little more, however.}
{1102}{}{Your actions have revealed you to be a champion of the people. Your war against evil and villainy is widely known. Honorable people will respect you better.}
{1103}{}{ }
#--- Dependencies
{1104}{}{You thoroughly enjoy Nuka-Cola, the pop of the post-nuclear world.}
{1105}{}{You are addicted to the drug Buffout. You must take this drug on an ongoing basis or suffer the effects of withdrawal.}
{1106}{}{You are suffering from Mentat addiction. You must take this particular drug or suffer withdrawal.}
{1107}{}{You have a drug addiction. If you do not take Psycho on a regular schedule, you will suffer. If you do, others will suffer.}
{1108}{}{Your body has become addicted to RadAway. While not life threatening, you must take it regularly.}
{1109}{}{You have a problem with alcohol. Actually, you have many problems with your drinking habits.}
{1110}{}{You have a drug addiction. You must take Jet on a regular basis.}
{1111}{}{Tragically, you are addicted to the Garnering. You are constantly in search of new expansions.}
#--- Karmic titles
{1112}{}{You have killed children, the youth of the wasteland. This is considered to be a really bad thing. You evil, evil person.}
{1113}{}{You've killed a lot of people. And you did it with style. Not everyone likes people like you, even in a post-nuclear world.}
{1114}{}{You are a born hunter. You've butchered so many wild animals that you've lost count.}
{1115}{}{You kill mutants. Cleansing the modern world from all kinds of mutants has become your calling. Some people admire you, others, you frighten.}
{1116}{}{You have reached level 12, and very few people (or even none) have died due to your fault. With such an outlook on life, it is a miracle that you yourself are still alive.}
#---Ranks
{1117}{}{You have joined the Brotherhood of Steel. Although your training is not yet complete, this already says a lot about your capabilities.}
{1118}{}{Your relentless dedication and unwavering service have significantly advanced the mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. In recognition of your exemplary efforts, the Elders bestow upon you the esteemed title of Accomplished Scribe.}
{1119}{}{Through your unwavering commitment and remarkable contributions, you have greatly furthered the Brotherhood's cause. As a testament to your achievements, the Elders honor you with the distinguished rank of Accomplished Knight.}
{1120}{}{Your valor and steadfast service have proven invaluable in advancing the Brotherhood's mission. In acknowledgment of your exceptional contributions, the Elders elevate you to the honored rank of Accomplished Paladin.}
{1121}{}{With your exceptional skills and relentless determination, you have made significant strides in advancing the goals of the Brotherhood. The Elders, in recognition of your outstanding service, confer upon you the respected title of Accomplished Scout.}
{1122}{}{You betrayed the Brotherhood of Steel after all they did for you. The Brotherhood does not forgive this. Never.}
{1123}{}{You have officially been accepted into the ranks of the Rangers. Now it is your responsibility to create order in the Wasteland.}
{1124}{}{The Church of the Holy Fire has accepted you into its narrow circle of initiates. Few have succeeded.}
{1125}{}{The Highwaymen now consider you one of their own and are ready to come to your aid from now on.}
{1126}{}{You are now a runaway slave. You will have to constantly hide from your pursuers until you manage to obtain your freedom from your slave owner.}
{1127}{}{You... have transformed. You've become a new person. This makes you see yourself in a new light. And the entire world around you.}
{1128}{}{You have rejected progress in favor of maintaining tradition. By doing this, you have inspired the people of the Villa and proven your dedication to the ideals of the community.}
{1129}{}{You have rejected tradition in favor of progress. You have your reasons, but most of the Villa's residents are unlikely to agree with you on this issue.}
{1130}{}{You are the heavyweight champion of Phoenix. You have gained fame, respect and love from thousands of fans.}

{2102}{}{Although, you're not greeted with open arms, most people in this area will at least nod in acknowledgment when you meet. You fit in as well as most.}
{2103}{}{Though normally suspicious of strangers, the people of this area haven't made up their minds about you yet.}
{2104}{}{You're just another out-of-towner in this area. Probably up to no good.}
{2105}{}{You've proven to the people in this area that their initial distrust was well founded. People in this area look at you and mutter to one another when you come near. They know you're up to no good.}
{2106}{}{Staring and muttering, some cross the street to avoid walking near you, while others, spit and turn away when you come near. Everyone knows that you're one of the worst things that's ever slithered into this area.}
