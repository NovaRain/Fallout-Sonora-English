{100}{}{You see peasant Lo.}
{101}{}{You see an elderly peasant woman with worn-out hands. She cracks her back.}
{102}{}{I'll call for help if you don't leave now.}

{210}{}{What do you need?}
{211}{}{What do you want?}
{212}{}{Who are you?}
{213}{}{I don't trade anything, sorry.}
{214}{}{Better talk to the mayor. We're just workers.}
{215}{}{Looks like you're at the wrong door.}

{220}{}{Good to see you.}
{221}{}{Well, have you settled into your new place?}
{222}{}{What do you want to talk about?}
{223}{}{Ola! It's great that you're still here.}
{224}{}{We are all grateful for your help.}

{229}{}{Bye.}

{230}{}{Who are you?}
{231}{}{My name is Lo.}
{232}{}{What are you doing, Lo?}
{233}{}{Working. On the plantation. That's my job.}
{234}{}{Not an easy job, I suppose?}
{235}{}{Work is always harder than waiting to ambush a caravan. Isn't it? Oh, sorry, I thought you were one of "those"...}
{236}{}{Hmm... I'll pretend I didn't hear that.}
{237}{}{Nevermind. I get that you don't trust a stranger.}

{240}{}{How do you like life here?}
{241}{}{Just wonderful! This is the best place in the wasteland. Of course, in exchange for protection and food, you have to work hard. But that's fair. Thanks to the Followers and Mayor Alvaro!}
{242}{}{Good that you're doing well.}
{243}{}{Are you speaking honestly?}
{244}{}{I'm telling you, there's no place like Casa Nueva. And those who don't like it can go elsewhere.}
{245}{}{Okay. I'll believe it this time.}
{246}{}{That's good. Good luck to you.}
{247}{}{I think you're exaggerating. After everything I've seen, it seems like you're living like slaves.}
{248}{}{Please... (looks around furtively) You shouldn't ask about this... There really are a lot of regulations and rules here. Some people can't stand it. We're forbidden to even discuss how things are.}
{249}{}{Why don't you fight for your rights?}
{250}{}{Because we don't have any. We are just peons... peasants signed to lifelong servitude, almost slaves... Any complaints here are strictly punished, and any public protest would be a direct road to the next world. Let's finish this. You shouldn't provoke the beast while it is sleeping.}
{251}{}{You've really cleared things up...}
{252}{}{Wait... Hmm. Surely I can speak... frankly with our hero?}
{1252}{}{Wait... Hmm. Surely I can speak... frankly with our heroine?}
{253}{}{Of course. What's bothering you?}
{254}{}{Well, it depends what you're talking about.}
{255}{}{All this time, I've had doubts in my heart about this place and how long it would last. So I kept some ammo with me in case I changed my mind and wanted to escape from here.}
{256}{}{Continue.}
{257}{}{So?}
{258}{}{Perhaps now I should forget about the past because the future is much more beautiful. Here, take these cartridges, you need them more than me.}
{259}{}{Thanks. This will really come in handy.}
{260}{}{If it's that important, I'll take them.}
