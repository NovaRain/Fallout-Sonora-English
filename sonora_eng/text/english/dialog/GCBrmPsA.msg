{100}{}{You see the head herder.}
{101}{}{You see a herder in tattered desert clothes.}

{111}{}{Okay, stranger, take the brahmin. And may our paths diverge.}
{1111}{}{Okay, stranger, take the brahmin. And may our paths diverge.}
{112}{}{I hope our paths never cross again.}

{200}{}{Stranger, do not come close to the brahmin. What you want from our peaceful camp?}
{1200}{}{Woman, do not come close to the brahmin. What you want from our peaceful camp?}
{201}{}{I need your brahmin... No, all of Garage City needs your brahmin.}
{202}{}{We do not share sacred animals with strangers. Leave us.}
{203}{}{Okay, I'll leave.}
{204}{}{Your loss. We'll just have to take it then!}

{220}{}{How did you manage to tame this animal?}
{221}{}{It was born among men. From another brahmin, who also lived among people. My people.}
{222}{}{So you're from San Brahmin?}
{223}{}{Northhorn Clan. Our people do not like noisy towns; we visit San Brahmin only for business.}
{224}{}{I see. Well, I won't bother you.}
{225}{}{I never knew that it was possible to tame wild beasts.}
{226}{}{We have kept our secrets from outsiders for many generations. If you San Brahmin, you will see everything with own eyes.}
{227}{}{I see. Well, I won't bother you.}

{230}{}{There are some scavengers over there. If you don't give them the brahmin, they will take it by force.}
{231}{}{Threats are common among pale-faces. Tell them we will defend ourselves. They cannot defeat those protected by the Spirit of the Wasteland.}
{232}{}{Leave the brahmin if you value your lives.}
{233}{}{We will not be cowed. I've spoken my word.}
{234}{}{Damn pale-faces! We leave. But let meat of this sacred animal poison you. Arrr!}
{235}{}{Smart decision.}
{236}{}{Trust me, I'm trying to save your skins. I am from Villa, we are friends of the San Brahmin tribes.}
{237}{}{I have heard of Villa. If you say they kill us, we have to believe. Tell these pale-faces not to touch us.}
{238}{}{You can't resist their weapons. Give up the brahmin, or be killed.}
{239}{}{I'm trying to avoid bloodshed.}

{240}{}{Maybe I can buy the brahmin?}
{241}{}{(look at each other) What can you offer us?}
{242}{}{Let's see...}
{243}{}{Honestly, I have nothing. Sorry to bother you unnecessarily.}
{244}{}{I offer you... death!}
{245}{}{The herders are no longer a hindrance to your plans.}
{246}{}{Now we part ways, stranger.}
{1246}{}{Now we part ways, stranger.}
{247}{}{[Done]}
