{100}{}{You see a scavenger.}
{101}{}{You see a filthy, emaciated man. His wild eyes hint at dark thoughts and ill intentions.}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{Stop! Take one more step and you're dead.}
{201}{}{I don't want trouble. Let's just talk.}
{202}{}{Oh really? I think it's the other way around.}

{203}{}{I'm not falling for your tricks. Get lost before I splatter your brains!}
{204}{}{Listen, we can't survive alone. I have a plan to get out of here. Let's team up, okay?}
{205}{}{No trick. I'm gonna kill you for that weapon.}
{206}{}{Alright, alright, I'm leaving, no need for violence.}
{207}{}{How do I know you're not setting me up?}
{208}{}{You don't trust easily, do you? But we need each other now.}

{209}{}{Damn it, I WANT out of here! Fine. We can team up. But don't think I'm taking a bullet for you.}
{210}{}{Well, it's a start.}
{211}{}{Look at us. Are two intelligent beings really enemies here?}
{212}{}{It's clear we need each other.}
{213}{}{Good luck, smooth skin. But I'm fine on my own.}

# Dialogue after communion
{220}{}{What do you want?}
{221}{}{Nothing.}

{230}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{231}{}{Not telling you anything.}
{232}{}{Uh, okay.}
{233}{}{At least give me your name.}
{234}{}{Name's Raul.}
{235}{}{Where are you from, Raul?}
{236}{}{I've wandered a lot. Mainly California and northern Mexico. Ever heard of Tijuana? That's my old stomping ground.}
{237}{}{A city in Mexico? You must have seen a lot.}
{238}{}{A century of wandering. And now I'm here, staring death in the face in this sand trap. I hoped for a different end.}
{239}{}{A hundred years? How did you live this long?}
{240}{}{The nukes did this to me. These aren't burns, it's something else. Seems to keep me alive. I don't know if I'm lucky or cursed.}
{241}{}{So, you're from the Old World!}
{242}{}{The Old World was something else. You wouldn't believe the tech we had. But you know what? People haven't changed. Still fighting over scraps, just like back then.}
{243}{}{Interesting perspective.}
{244}{}{Why did the Tinsmiths send... a ghoul here?}
{245}{}{Because after all these years, I know more than any smoothskinned. Add my immunity to radiation, and I'm perfect for old base ops. But truth is, I have no clue how to disable the damn defenses in this storage facility!}
{246}{}{Got it.}
{247}{}{Enough with these pointless questions.}
{248}{}{Do you know anything about the Inferno Ghouls?}
{249}{}{I didn't fit in with them. I've still got enough sanity to avoid going feral. But those ghouls? They're beyond saving. Demons.}

# The consignment
{250}{}{Come with me.}
{251}{}{Just stay out of the thick of it. And remember, I'm not going into the bunker.}
{252}{}{We'll see...}
{253}{}{Wait here, I'm scouting ahead.}
{254}{}{Don't try to double-cross me.}
{255}{}{Of course...}

{260}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{261}{}{It's an old military storage site. Force fields and minefields guard the perimeter. Hostile robots are everywhere, controlled by a computer in an underground bunker.}
{262}{}{What can I expect in the bunker?}
{263}{}{Probably lots of killer robots and some massive supercomputer. Doubt there are any people left. If you're going down there, prep well.}
