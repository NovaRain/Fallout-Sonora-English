{100}{}{You see Lozen.}
{101}{}{You see an ancient crone in garb unusual for her tribe. She mutters under her breath, likely casting a spell.}

{200}{}{Ah, I know you come to my place, wanderer. Spirits tell me your sad tale.}
{201}{}{How do you know?}
{202}{}{I see much, blood of sacred beasts shows all. I am Lozen, seer of fates.}
{203}{}{So, what, you tell fortunes with brahmin blood or something?}
{204}{}{I look into rivers of time, past and future. Call it what you will. Show me hands, and I tell your destiny.}
{205}{}{Uh, no thanks.}
{206}{}{Alright, let's see.}
{207}{}{Hmm... great troubles come. I see you stand in storm's eye. But to see more, full ritual must be done.}
{208}{}{Maybe another time.}
{209}{}{Alright, I'm curious. What do you need for this ritual?}
{210}{}{Sacrifice needed, something precious to you. Caps will do. Only in loss can true life be seen.}
{211}{}{Here, take 100 caps. I want to know everything!}
{212}{}{Maybe another time.}
{213}{}{(performs a complex ritual with the blood of a sacred animal) Um-mm... Um-mm... Spirits speak... Yes...}
{214}{}{What do you see?}
{215}{}{I see warriors with stars... and others make fire with thoughts, fighting. You stand between, caught in fire...}
{216}{}{That doesn't sound good.}
{217}{}{But fear not! Divine Brahmin protects you in fight. You have path set by fate! Do not stray! Great mission waits you! GREAT!!!}
{218}{}{Whoa, that was intense. But how am I supposed to interpret this?}
{219}{}{You're tricking me! This isn't a vision of the future.}
{220}{}{Listen to me! Divine Brahmin gives visions, not orders. You must understand vision. Maybe time not right. When your heart and mind agree, you see clearly.}
{221}{}{This was a waste of caps. Goodbye.}
{1221}{}{This is a waste of caps. Goodbye.}
{222}{}{Thank you, Lozen. Your words inspire me to move forward.}
{223}{}{You come back. I see destiny still calls you. Shall I look at your future again?}
{1223}{}{You come back. I see destiny still calls you. Shall I look at your future again?}
{224}{}{No, no thanks.}

{240}{}{I have nothing more to tell you.}
{241}{}{Alright. Goodbye.}
{242}{}{But, what did your vision mean?}
{243}{}{What happened to the brahmin whose blood you used?}
{244}{}{Sacred beast. Genaro prepares it for Day of Sun. On this day, beast is sacrificed, and with its sacred blood, we cleanse ourselves of failure and shame. I use blood to see our possible futures and share with our people.}
{245}{}{What kind of celebration is this?}
{246}{}{When sandstorms cover Sonoran Desert, herders cannot graze brahmin. We stay in pueblo, waiting out storm season. During these days, when food is plenty, we thank Divine Brahmin for our survival.}
{247}{}{What makes this sacred animal special?}
{248}{}{A brahmin of great strength. Genaro keeps it in separate pen, safe from harm, until Day of Sun. Its death or sickness would be disaster for us.}
{249}{}{Don't you feel pity for this sacred beast?}
{250}{}{No! Brahmin sacrifice for us. Genaro picks one and cares for it all year, year of clean, well-fed happiness, only to die and give tribe redemption. Noble end for noble creature.}
{251}{}{What future do you see for your tribe?}
{252}{}{We stand on edge of chasm, covered in mist. Future is unclear.}
{253}{}{Intriguing.}
