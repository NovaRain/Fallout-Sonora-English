{100}{}{You see George Crook.}
{101}{}{You see a man with a great mustache and a determined look.}
{102}{}{Correct. Now go and kill all the savages. You understand orders, right, robot?}
{103}{}{Take care of yourself. Maybe we'll meet again.}
{104}{}{I'll have to go back to Phoenix. God knows I did what I could.}

#First meeting
{200}{}{Stop. What are you doing here?}
{201}{}{I don't know. Just wandering around here.}
{202}{}{Don't mess with me. I can see right through you bumpkins. You're clearly not from Phoenix, which means you're from somewhere in the wasteland. Where? Answer.}
{203}{}{I don't have to answer to you.}
{1203}{}{I don't have to answer to you.}
{204}{}{Well, well. In front of me is a proud and unbending hick. Think you're in the right here? Soon the entire wasteland will be under the heel of Aaron and his army! And then we'll see how far your pride gets you.}
{1204}{}{Well, well. Before me is a proud and unbending hick. Think you're in the right here? Soon the entire wasteland will be under the heel of Aaron and his army! And then we'll see how far your pride gets you.}
{205}{}{Really?}
{206}{}{You, peasant, will have no choice but to bend the knee. You'll get it soon enough. In the meantime, I'll give you a chance to smarten up. Go back to the wasteland and tell everyone about the greatness of the Phoenix army.}
{1206}{}{You, peasant woman, will have no choice but to bend the knee. You'll get it soon enough. In the meantime, I'll give you a chance to smarten up. Go back to the wasteland and tell everyone about the greatness of the Phoenix army.}
{207}{}{I'm leaving.}
{208}{}{I won't leave without answers to my questions.}
{209}{}{Aaron sent me to help. Here's his sealed order.}
{210}{}{My village is empty. So I'm going wherever my feet lead me.}
{211}{}{Well then, kid. Go to Phoenix. There is nothing to do in the desert, but in a big city there's a lot of opportunities. Just don't choose the wrong ones. If you know what I mean.}
{212}{}{Yeah, I understand.}
{213}{}{Great. For now, I'll assume we're on the same side.}
{214}{}{Okay. So What's going on here?}
{215}{}{Uhh... not really.}
{216}{}{I represent Aaron's rule in these lands. Aaron appreciates those who honor him. And he is very harsh with those who stand in his way. You'd better choose your side wisely.}
{217}{}{I see.}
{218}{}{Okay, okay. What's going on here though?}

{220}{}{Wait... Hmm? Familiar robe. Aaron sent you?}
{221}{}{I don't know who you're talking about. It's just an old robe.}
{222}{}{Then forget it. What are you doing here?}
{223}{}{Yes, Aaron sent me. He wants to know the situation.}
{224}{}{I don't understand his train of thought. I will soon have nothing to feed my squad, and he's sending another mouth to feed.}
{225}{}{I have a special task. Aaron has grown tired of waiting for results.}
{226}{}{I think he just wants a quick solution to the problem.}
{227}{}{Hmm. I'm already curious about how you gained Aaron's trust. Considering that, perhaps I should listen to your advice. Keep in mind, though, that I'm still the Commander here.}
{228}{}{No problem.}
{229}{}{I don't care about your command.}

{230}{}{I represent the Rangers. We've heard talk that someone is trying to break the herder tribe.}
{231}{}{We are just peaceful colonizers. They came to empty land to establish a settlement here. Are we doing something bad?}
{232}{}{You are trying to drive the tribe away.}
{233}{}{I'll tell you what. Listen carefully, ranger henchman. These lands do not belong to you. And they don't belong to savages either. Aaron of Phoenix owns this entire valley. Get back to your people. And don't you dare get in our way.}
{234}{}{You've said enough. I don't need more.}
{235}{}{I'm not leaving until I get answers to my questions. What's going on here?}

#Re-dialogue
{250}{}{Well? Speak. I'm listening.}
{251}{}{Allow me to go.}
{252}{}{What are you all doing here?}

{260}{}{This land belongs to His Majesty Aaron, Lord of the Church of the Holy Fire and Lord of Phoenix. He's decided to found a colony here. But our mission is being interfered with by the local savages.}
{261}{}{What's the problem with these savages?}
{262}{}{They weren't hostile before. Now they're trying to drive us away with threats and force. We don't want unnecessary bloodshed, in fact, we offer them a mutually beneficial alliance.}
{263}{}{So why not leave the savages be?}
{264}{}{Their brahmin are too valuable in Phoenix. Without them, there's going to be a food shortage. Besides, if they've turned hostile, we can't just leave them right under our noses.}
{265}{}{[More]}
{266}{}{In any case, I'm not in charge of the whole thing. I'm following orders from command in Phoenix. The settlement order is clear to me. But the demands of the nomadic, illiterate savages have little bearing.}
{267}{}{I see.}
{268}{}{Listen. The savages don't want to deal with me anymore. But you could. Talk to their leader, try to convince him that an alliance is in his best interests.}
{269}{}{I'm not going to get involved in someone else's war. My own problems are more important.}
{270}{}{Do your problems compare to a war between two nations? Then pray that it doesn't affect you and your family.}
{271}{}{I gotta go.}
{272}{}{I'll try. I'll let you know how things go.}

{280}{}{I was able to talk to the leader. But he flatly refuses the alliance.}
{281}{}{Geronimo is too stubborn. Looks like I'm wasting my time with him. We need to act more decisively.}
{282}{}{What's your plan?}
{283}{}{I know that not all the savages hate us. Young people are even trying to help. Among them is the chief's son, Chatto. Talk to him, find out what he wants. If he takes his father's place, we can come to an agreement.}
{284}{}{Alright. It's worth a try.}
{285}{}{I killed Geronimo and his successor Chatto.}
{1285}{}{I killed Geronimo and his successor Chatto.}
{286}{}{That's a right fuckup! Geronimo resisted the alliance. But Chatto would have welcomed it, if he had taken his father's place. Now we have no one to negotiate with. The tribes will scatter across the desert, once again breaking up into small clans.}
{287}{}{I didn't think that far ahead...}
{288}{}{But you yourself hinted that you wanted to get rid of the leader.}
{289}{}{Well, in any case, things have actually gotten easier. We'll settle in the pueblo and force the savages to accept our rules by force. They won't be able to resist us, especially without a leader.}
{290}{}{Well, I guess it's time to congratulate you on your victory?}
{291}{}{Not yet. The scouts found out who was raising dust in this pueblo. It turned out to be a man named Oscar. A ranger! Now I understand where the locals were getting their basic tactics and guerrilla tricks.}
{292}{}{[More]}
{293}{}{The ranger needs to be driven out of the San Brahmin! We don't even want to remember his name. If he doesn't want to leave, we'll drive him with a whip, like a stubborn brahmin.}
{294}{}{Okay. I'll see what I can do.}
{295}{}{Chatto has taken over as the leader of the tribe. And he agrees to an alliance!}
{296}{}{Great news! Now Chatto has power in the eyes of the rest of the tribe, his authority will keep the tribe gathered here. For us to use. Very good work. You made an excellent 'diplomat'.}
{297}{}{The high Chief has agreed to an alliance. I managed to convince him, although it wasn't easy.}
{298}{}{Great news. I doubt he's changed his views that much though. He was likely put under pressure by the other elders who are afraid of war. But it's good work. You made an excellent 'diplomat'.}

{300}{}{Oscar is dead. His followers in camp will also bow the knee to you, commander.}
{301}{}{This is a victory! We've dealt a decisive blow to the reputation of the Rangers in front of the whole tribe. Now they'll get who holds power in this wasteland.}
{302}{}{Oscar has fled San Brahmin and will no longer interfere with your plans.}
{303}{}{This is a victory! In the eyes of the savages, that ranger has dropped to the level of a cowardly iguana. Now even they should be able to grasp who wields the real power in this wasteland}
{304}{}{Glad to help, Commander!}
{1304}{}{I was glad to help, Commander!}
{305}{}{Ahem. Actually, *you* know who made this happen.}
{306}{}{You've done the Empire proud. If the rest had half your grit and battle spirit, we'd be unstoppable. I'm glad we're on the same side.}
{1306}{}{You've done the Empire proud. If the rest had half your grit and battle spirit, we'd be unstoppable. I'm glad we're on the same side.}
{307}{}{Do you think Aaron's empire still needs heroes?}
{308}{}{Of course. I'll send a letter of recommendation in your name to Phoenix. Go straight to Aaron, he values my word.}
{309}{}{Thanks.}
{310}{}{No, don't thank me. We follow a common cause. Good luck on your journey, partner.}
{311}{}{Good luck.}

{320}{}{Who are you? And who are all these people?}
{321}{}{Tell me about yourself and your squad.}
{322}{}{George Crook, field commander to His Majesty Aaron, Lord of the Church of the Holy Fire and Lord of Phoenix. And this is my squad. When we clear the territory of enemies, a group of simple settlers will come after us.}
{323}{}{It was nice talking to you. But I gotta go.}
{324}{}{Isn't the ruler's title a little long?}
{325}{}{Hold your tongue. Aaron's empire is quite large and is constantly expanding. Soon all of Arizona will be under his thumb.}
{326}{}{Again, who are you?}
{327}{}{Where did you all come from?}
{328}{}{We came from Phoenix to establish a colony here. But we found it already occupied by savages.}
{329}{}{Where is this Phoenix?}
{330}{}{A city southeast of here. But it's strange that you've never heard of it. It's the largest city in this entire region.}
{331}{}{I don't know. I'm actually from a small, isolated village in the opposite direction, so...}
{332}{}{I see then. That's Ranger land. It's not surprising that in your area there's only villages and no actual civilization. Take a look at Phoenix and you'll see what a real city is.}
{333}{}{I'll do that. Thanks for the advice.}
{334}{}{I don't care about this "civilization" of yours.}
{335}{}{Tell me about the tribe.}
{336}{}{They're a wild tribe of herders and nomads. Phoenix has long had a difficult relationship with them. We've suffered from their aggression in the past.}
{337}{}{By the way, what do you know about the locals?}
{338}{}{You don't seem to like them?}
{339}{}{Savages! They crawl like fleas in the desert. And as soon as you settle anywhere, they immediately claim it was 'their land'.}
{340}{}{Continue.}
{341}{}{Some radical clans even attack civilians. Phoenix has been trying to negotiate peace for several years. And some clans even came over to our side. But not all. Now my squad has felt the stubborness of these savages firsthand.}
{342}{}{Now I get why you're so bristling with weapons. Peace. I gotta go.}
{343}{}{Are you from Phoenix too?}

{350}{}{You must leave San Brahmin. You and your entire squad.}
{351}{}{What are you talking about?}
{352}{}{Well, you don't want to piss off the tribe, right?}
{353}{}{First of all, I want to put these savages in their place. It wouldn't hurt for you to reconsider your outlook on life either.}
{354}{}{Okay. I said what I had to say.}
{355}{}{If you don't leave, there's gonna be blood.}
{356}{}{Whoever sent you, tell him that George Crook knows no fear. Words don't scare me.}
{357}{}{Well, I warned you. Blood's gonna flow like a river, right now!}
{1357}{}{Well, I warned you. Blood's gonna flow like a river, right now!}
{358}{}{Okay. I heard you.}
{1358}{}{Okay. I heard you.}
{359}{}{The tribe is ready for decisive action. Your presence here only gives them a reason.}
{360}{}{I know the savages won't give up so easily. They're just too far from the ideal of the New World that my master is building. Yet that is precisily why my mission is so important - to show the savages that they live in an outdated and deadend way of life. Show them that there can be a better world.}
{361}{}{Okay. I'm not gonna argue.}
{362}{}{I get it. However, angering them will only push the tribe towards their traditions, and away from your ideals. Give them time to think. In the end, your mission will end in failure if they attack.}
{363}{}{Damn these savages! I was already considering a return to Phoenix. My people are tired, we're running out of supplies, and now, the savages are ready to come at us from behind every dune.}
{364}{}{So what will you do?}
{365}{}{Not much choice. We'll have to leave. But only to return with more men, and renewed vigor.}
{366}{}{A smart decision, commander. Good luck on your return.}
