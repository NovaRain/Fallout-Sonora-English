{100}{}{You see a farmer, engrossed in his typical peaceful chores.}
{101}{}{You see a typical farmer, fully immersed in his familiar, tranquil tasks.}

#First Dialogue
{200}{}{Get out, and don't come back! Don't you dare stir up trouble among decent folk. I don't know how the world even puts up with the likes of you...}  
{201}{}{Take it easy, old-timer.}
{202}{}{I'm not here to cause any trouble.}
{210}{}{(You observe a farmer clad in a plaid shirt, worn work pants, and a weathered hat; as you approach, he grips his rake and scrutinizes you from head to toe, squinting; it's clear he's not keen on lengthy conversations.)}
{211}{}{My apologies for the intrusion. I'm looking for the nearest settlement.}
{212}{}{Hey, old-timer, where's the closest watering hole? I could use a drink *right now*.}
{213}{}{New around here? Well, welcome to Ranger territory. If you're seeking protection or a place to rest, head further down the road - that's where the Rangers have set up their stronghold, right on the old dam.}
{214}{}{Mind if I ask you a couple of questions?}
{215}{}{I'll make my way there then.}
{216}{}{Doubt you'll find what you're looking for here. Just a bit further down the road lies the Ranger base, right on top of the old dam. They won't take too kindly if you wander over there asking questions like that.}
{220}{}{So, what's eatin' you?}
{221}{}{Don't beat around the bush, just ask.}
{222}{}{Interesting... Anyway, could I ask you about something else?}
{223}{}{Seems like you've settled in nicely. Let's discuss something else.}
{224}{}{Sorry, but I gotta go now.}
{225}{}{}
{226}{}{Just wanted to say hello. And... Bye.}
{227}{}{You again? Hmm... you've got an ominous air about you. Like those crazed cultists from the east. Say, you're not one of those types who worships old relics and radiation symbols, are you? If so, heed this: the Rangers aren't too fond of your sort.}
{228}{}{I appreciate the heads up, but I'm not in the habit of worshipping radioactivity.}
{229}{}{Don't mock the truth, feeble atom! Or I'll be laughing at your grave.}

#Questions
{230}{}{So, what can you tell me about yourself and this farm?}
{231}{}{Well, we're just trying to keep this place running, struggling with our crops and all. And the Rangers, well, they do their part in keeping us safe from trouble.}
{232}{}{How long have you been living here?}
{233}{}{We've been here for over ten years now, weathering through each season. Without the Rangers, we probably wouldn't have made it this far.}
{234}{}{Who else lives here, besides your family?}
{235}{}{Further down the road, you'll find the Rangers' stronghold on the old dam. It's the main settlement around here. Aqueduct is a small village east of the dam. Other families, farms, and seasonal hunter camps are scattered across the area.}
{236}{}{And what about that abandoned shack over there?}
{237}{}{No one's lived there since the old owner passed away after gettin' stung by a radscorpion.}
{238}{}{Why are your crops struggling?}
{239}{}{The drought's been hitting us hard. Things would be a lot better if we had a proper irrigation system.}
{240}{}{Is it safe here?}
{241}{}{Well, you'd think it'd be safer, right here by the Rangers, nowhere's completely safe these days. But... compared to other places, it's relatively peaceful. Raiders tend to steer clear, thanks to the Rangers. As for mutants, we've mostly got issues with radscorpions, especially during the dry season when they migrate from the south.}
{242}{}{Tell me about the radscorpions.}
{243}{}{They're big, tough creatures with impenetrable shells. The farther south you go, the bigger and more dangerous they get. During hot seasons, they migrate here, and it's best to stay indoors at night when they're on the prowl.}
{244}{}{Do you know any weak spots on them?}
{245}{}{Their belly's the softest spot, but it's not easy to hit. Breaking their legs first might help, but the most effective way to deal with them is fire.}
{246}{}{Looks like there's been a fight on the road.}
{247}{}{Yeah, the Rangers have been tracking down a spy in the area for days. Turns out, he was hiding in that shack over there. Now everyone knows who's in charge around here.}
{250}{}{What can you tell me about the Rangers?}
{251}{}{If you're not one of them, you probably won't hear anything new from me. Better to ask the Rangers at their stronghold.}
{252}{}{Fair enough. I had another question.}
{253}{}{Well, time for me to move on. Bye.}
{254}{}{The Rangers are the ones keeping things orderly and safe around here. They're willing to risk their lives to maintain justice and law in this damned wasteland.}
{255}{}{So they provide protection for you?}
{256}{}{Exactly. We pay them in crops, and they help keep raiders and mutants at bay. It's a straightforward arrangement.}
{257}{}{What if you don't want to share with the Rangers?}
{258}{}{The wasteland's vast. If you don't like dealing with the Rangers, you can always go somewhere else. But honestly, they're better than most alternatives.}
{259}{}{I feel like there's more to the story. What's really going on around here?}
{260}{}{I've told you what I know. The Rangers keep order, and we pay our share. It's just how things have to be, given the way things are.}  
{261}{}{Hmm...}
{262}{}{The Rangers keep us safe, sure... but sometimes it feels like they take more than their share. Giving up so much of our crops is a real burden, but without them, we'd be easy pickings for raiders. So, we pay, even if it doesn't sit right.}  
{263}{}{I get it.}
{264}{}{I need to find the leader of the Rangers. How can I do that?}
{265}{}{Reaching the general won't be easy. He stays holed up in the dam, and the entrance is locked down tight. If you want in, you'll need a damn good reason.}  
{266}{}{The folks at Garage City are in desperate need of supplies.}
{267}{}{That scavenger settlement the Rangers have had issues with? No surprise they're struggling.}
{268}{}{You could try trading with them - offer some of your crops in exchange for machinery and repairs.}  
{269}{}{Not a bad idea... I know some other farmers who might be interested in getting their hands on some machinery too, especially if it helps with farming. And the Rangers would certainly see the value in that kind of deal. Would them scavengers really be up for it?}
{270}{}{Definitely. Sounds like a plan to me. I'll let the folks at Garage City know you're willing to trade.}

#Give water
{288}{}{Please just leave, peacefully.}
{289}{}{Of course, I don't want any trouble.}
{290}{}{Would you be willing to share some clean water?}
{291}{}{Why should we share our supplies with you? For all we know, you could be a bandit or an enemy of the Rangers. State your business first, and then we'll talk.}  
{292}{}{Alright. Can I ask you a few questions first though?}
{293}{}{I'll remember this...}
{294}{}{Here, take as much as you need. I'm happy to share with a Ranger.}
{295}{}{Thanks...}
{296}{}{I'm not a bandit. Quite the opposite - I, uh, was attacked by them.}
{297}{}{That sounds rough. Here, have another sip. But I can't offer much more than that. You might want to seek more help from the Rangers.}
{298}{}{Come on, be generous. Let a guest have a few more sips.}
{1298}{}{Come on, be generous. Let a guest have a few more sips.}
{299}{}{Hmm, alright. Just a bit more for you. Hold onto it carefully... don't spill!}

#Fixing the Tank
{300}{}{Can't the Rangers repair the water tank?}
{301}{}{The Rangers are good people, but they're not exactly skilled with technology. There's no one here who can fix that water tank. I've been trying myself, but it's beyond me, especially at my age.}
{302}{}{I can fix it.}
{303}{}{Really? That would be incredibly helpful! If you can manage it, we'll share what little food and water we have. It's the least we can do.}
{304}{}{I'll consider it.}
{305}{}{The water tank isn't leaking anymore.}
{306}{}{Well, I'll be... you're quite the handyman! You should consider offering your skills to the Rangers. They could use someone like you.}
{1306}{}{Well, I'll be... you're quite the handyman! You should consider offering your skills to the Rangers. They could use someone like you.}
{307}{}{Hmm. I was expecting a little something for my trouble.}
{1307}{}{Hmm. I was expecting a little something for my trouble.}
{308}{}{Here's what I can spare - some clean water and a few fruits. I'm sorry it's not more, but with the drought and the leaky tank, we're stretched thin.}
{309}{}{Thanks, friend.}
{310}{}{Take care.}
{311}{}{Goodbye.}
{312}{}{I didn't fix it for scraps. Give me the rest of your supplies, or I'll give that tank a good whack.}
{1312}{}{I didn't fix it for scraps. Give me the rest of your supplies, or I'll give that tank a good whack.}
{313}{}{Alright, alright, calm down. You'll get more food and water, but that's all we have left. Take it and go in peace.}
{314}{}{Thanks, old man.}
{315}{}{Alright. Maybe I will.}
{316}{}{You sure you don't want anything for your work? Well, thanks in any case. Take care now.}
{317}{}{You too.}

#Search for a dog
{350}{}{Sounds like something... bad happened?}
{351}{}{Yeah, you read me right. Our dog's gone missing, and someone's been raiding our crops. My bet's on those damn radscorpions. If you come across any signs of our dog, gimme a holler.}
{352}{}{Sure thing.}
{353}{}{I found your dog's remains. Looks like she was attacked.}
{1353}{}{I found your dog's remains. Looks like she was attacked.}
{354}{}{What the hell... Who could've done such a thing?!}
{355}{}{It was a bandit, one who slipped past the Rangers. Your dog tried to put a stop to him swiping your crops.}
{356}{}{Not sure yet. Maybe it'll come together later.}
{357}{}{So that's the rat that's been tearing up our farm! If there's a bandit holed up nearby, things just got a whole lot worse. Listen, head to the Rangers and give 'em the lowdown on this pronto!}
{358}{}{I'm heading the other way, sorry. You'll have to handle this on your own.}
{359}{}{Got it. Soon as I get there, I'll fill them in.}
{360}{}{No need to worry - that bandit won't be causing you any more grief.}
