{100}{}{You see the cashier.}
{101}{}{You see a surprisingly diligent and efficient looking cashier. It appears she's been well-trained in all her duties.}
{102}{}{S-sorry, but you'll have to take that off... Or-or I'll call security...}

{105}{}{Security! There's a bandit here!}
{106}{}{Security! Outsider alert!}
{107}{}{Leave this room immediately.}
{108}{}{Leave now. This is a service area.}
{109}{}{}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{Hello, sir. New to our casino?}
{1200}{}{Hello, ma'am. New to our casino?}
{201}{}{Yes. Can you explain the casino rules?}
{202}{}{The rules of each game will be explained by the dealer. My job is to exchange caps for game chips. Inside the casino, they take the place of currency, but you can always exchange them back, here at the cashier's desk.}
{203}{}{I see.}
{204}{}{Not really. I'm good friends with Don Diego. Keep that in mind.}
{205}{}{Oh, sorry, I wasn't told about you. But keep in mind that the casino rules are the same for everyone. Including Don Diego's friends.}
{206}{}{Hmph. I see.}
{209}{}{As an honorary member of the club, I should get an exception, right?}

# Re-dialogue
{210}{}{How may I help you?}
{211}{}{Thanks, that's all.}
{212}{}{Uh... yeah?}
{213}{}{Is the casino still open?}
{214}{}{Oh, yes. We're still repairing the interior after the cathedral explosion, but you can use all the standard entertainment... if you don't mind the mess.}
{215}{}{A mess? You do realize we live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, right?? I'm no stranger to a little mess.}
{216}{}{So the casino is in disrepair? That's it, I'm outta here.}
{217}{}{Sorry, but I'm not allowed to provide you service. I can only exchange your chips if you have any left. Please contact the manager if you have any concerns.}
{218}{}{What?! The service here is terrible.}
{219}{}{Then I'll find another casino. Goodbye.}

# Disclosure of goods for collateral
{220}{}{Can I leave a deposit or exchange some of my stuff?}
{221}{}{I'm afraid this isn't in the best interests of the casino. We prefer bottle caps. However, we sometimes make exceptions.}
{222}{}{Okay, never mind.}
{223}{}{Can Don Diego's friends count on this exception?}
{224}{}{Of course, we can make an exception for you. But the cap limit for such purposes is restricted.}
{225}{}{Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.}
{226}{}{Yes, but I have not been informed to make an exception for *you*.}
{227}{}{No problem.}
{228}{}{I'm a merchant, you can be certain about my future business.}
{229}{}{I see. I think we can make an exception for you. But the cap limit for such purposes is restricted.}
{230}{}{Thanks. I'll remember that you have some caps for exchange.}
{231}{}{I believe you. But here at the casino, we prefer caps. You can exchange your items at the local market.}
{232}{}{You shouldn't refuse.}
{233}{}{Doesn't my name mean anything in this city?}
{234}{}{Sorry, you're absolutely right. From now on you can count on a deposit.}
{235}{}{Thanks. I'll keep in mind that you have some caps now.}
{236}{}{Sorry, but your reputation does not pull much weight in this city.}
{237}{}{Bitch, what are you implying?}
{238}{}{Sorry, but we can't help you.}
{239}{}{Oh well.}

# Game denial
{240}{}{I hate to inform you, but the manager told me not to serve you anymore.}
{241}{}{How's that? I won't be able to play in the casino anymore?}
{242}{}{He's crazy. What the hell does that even mean?}
{243}{}{Sorry, I have strict orders. Please address all complaints to the manager. I can exchange all your game chips, but I am prohibited from giving out new ones.}
{244}{}{In that case, I just need to talk to the manager. I'll be back.}
{245}{}{Of course, there's scams all around. Damn casino...}
{246}{}{Wait! Um, I'm sorry... sir...}
{1246}{}{Wait! Um, I'm sorry... ma'am...}
{247}{}{Is something wrong?}

# Exchange
{250}{}{I want to exchange caps for casino chips.}
{251}{}{How many caps would you like to exchange?}
{252}{}{10 caps.}
{253}{}{50 caps.}
{254}{}{100 caps.}
{255}{}{500 caps.}
{256}{}{1000 caps.}
{257}{}{None actually.}
{258}{}{You're welcome. (you received casino chips in exchange for caps)}
{259}{}{Thanks.}
{260}{}{You don't have enough caps.}
{261}{}{Okay.}
{262}{}{You're welcome. (you received caps in exchange for casino chips)}
{263}{}{Thanks.}
{264}{}{You don't have enough chips.}
{265}{}{Okay.}
{266}{}{You don't have enough money.}
{267}{}{All the caps I have.}
{268}{}{You're welcome. (you received caps in exchange for pre-war money)}
{269}{}{Thanks.}

{270}{}{I want to trade game chips for bottle caps.}
{271}{}{How many chips would you like to exchange?}
{272}{}{10 chips.}
{273}{}{50 chips.}
{274}{}{100 chips.}
{275}{}{500 chips.}
{276}{}{1000 chips.}
{277}{}{None actually.}
{278}{}{All the chips I have.}

{280}{}{Why are caps so important?}
{281}{}{Caps are currency. Like pre-war money. They're used to exchange for goods. But unlike dollars, the exchange rate of caps is set by the Followers of Fire. It's one of those wise ideas the Followers brought to Phoenix.}
{282}{}{So you accept pre-war money?}
{283}{}{Yes, it's possible. Pre-war dollars, though depreciated, still introduce some uncertainty into the exchange rate of caps. Would you like to exchange?}
{284}{}{No, thanks. But I'll keep it in mind.}
{285}{}{}
{286}{}{Yes, I would.}
{287}{}{It's possible. But note that dollars have halved in value. Previously, the rate was controlled by the Followers of Fire, but since the incident at the Cathedral, they can't perform this function anymore.}
{288}{}{I see.}
{289}{}{All the pre-war dollars I have.}

{290}{}{I want to exchange pre-war money.}
{291}{}{How many dollars would you like to exchange?}
{292}{}{1 dollar.}
{293}{}{2 dollars.}
{294}{}{3 dollars.}
{295}{}{4 dollars.}
{296}{}{5 dollars.}
{297}{}{10 dollars.}
{298}{}{50 dollars.}
{299}{}{Not at all.}
