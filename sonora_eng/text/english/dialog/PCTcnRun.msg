{100}{}{You see a gambler.}
{101}{}{You see a casino visitor. He looks like he's ready to complain about the service and the entire world.}
{102}{}{Leave me alone. I want to get drunk and watch the whole city burn.}

{110}{}{How dare you toss me out onto the street?}
{111}{}{I demand an apology!}
{112}{}{If it weren't for me, this city would be in the dark.}
{113}{}{Do you even know who I am?}
{114}{}{You think this is funny? Laughing at me, huh?}

{200}{}{(shouting towards the casino) ...Hey, you! You'll hear about this, you greedy bastards!}
{201}{}{What's going on here?}
{202}{}{Oh, great, another one. Trying to hit the jackpot at the casino, huh? Forget it. That place is run by crooks...}
{203}{}{Are you drunk or something?}
{204}{}{Drunk? I've had a few, like half the city. Women and kids included.}
{205}{}{I see.}
{206}{}{Do you? Ah, forget it. I used to work for the best caravan, and now they won't even give me a discount in this filthy dive. Some gratitude...}
{207}{}{Caravan? What kind of caravan?}
{208}{}{The one that hauled ore to Two-Sun. Now the rigs are rusting in the sun, and I'm out of a job. Thanks to some moron.}
{209}{}{You know, I don't think he meant for that to happen...}
{210}{}{Screw you! (waves you off and walks away)}
{1210}{}{Fuck off bitch! (waves you off and walks away)}
{211}{}{Hmph...}
{212}{}{You brought this on yourself, dealing with shady characters.}
{213}{}{Tinsmiths? Yeah, they powered the whole city... real bastards. Ah, you wouldn't get it. (waves you off, muttering as he walks away)}
{214}{}{Whatever you say, man.}
