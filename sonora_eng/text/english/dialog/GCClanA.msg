{100}{}{You see Trayvon.}
{101}{}{You see a dark-skinned man in dirty clothes.}
{110}{}{Get someone else.}

# Floating replicas during disassembly
{111}{}{Tell me what you have in mind.}
{112}{}{Did you really think you could escape?}
{113}{}{Damn rats, I never liked you!}
{114}{}{What the hell is going on here?}
{115}{}{Hold them tight or they'll run away.}
{116}{}{Your not getting away with it.}
{117}{}{What do you have to say in your defense?}
{118}{}{You won't get away with this.}
{119}{}{That was your last mistake.}

# Dialogue during a skirmish
{200}{}{(a tense scene unfolds before you - a group of scavengers has surrounded a couple of other scavengers and is about to beat them up; but your appearance disrupts their plans) Who are you?}
{201}{}{Mr. Kogan sent me. What the hell's going on here?}
{202}{}{We're about to teach Lucas' boys a lesson. These fuckin' runts think a little too highly of themselves, stealing our shit and workin' our turf.}
{203}{}{Aren't you all in the same group?}
{204}{}{We're all part of Mr. Kogan's cartel. But each clan has its own territory. We toed the line; Lucas's people crossed it.}
{205}{}{So what exactly did they do?}
{206}{}{They stole the decoder that Mr. Kogan entrusted to us. Then they fled the city. We caught these two fuckers, and now they'll face the music.}

{207}{}{Got it. You can carry on.}
{208}{}{Then go to the boss and tell him everything. We won't just let this go... Stop, you little shit! Where d'you think you're going?! (taking advantage of the moment, the detainees try to escape)}
{209}{}{Uh...}

{210}{}{Are you sure killing them is worth it? You're all from the same city and the same group.}
{211}{}{Sure it is. Our city is dying. The ruins and old factories in the north are all we've got. But Lucas won't share. He'll take everything for himself. We gotta do something!}
{212}{}{You're right, do what you have to do.}

{213}{}{Let them go. Why spill more blood?}
{214}{}{I can't let Lucas get his hands on my turf.}
{215}{}{I'm sorry I can't talk you out of it.}
{216}{}{You're right, do what you have to do.}

{217}{}{What, let them go so they can join up with Lucas? That's stupid!}
{218}{}{You're right, it's stupid. Do what you want.}
{219}{}{Calm down. Two lives on your conscience won't change the situation with Lucas.}
{220}{}{Well, maybe you're right. Maybe you can help us get the factory back? Probably not. (pause) Shit, just let them go.}
{221}{}{Good decision. I'll tell Mr. Kogan about this.}
{222}{}{Good decision.}

{230}{}{Who are you?}
{231}{}{Mr. Kogan sent me. What's going on?}
{232}{}{Lucas is a sneaky fuckin' rat. He stole the decoder that Mr. Kogan gave us and holed up in the factory. But that factory is our turf!}
{233}{}{I see. I'll go tell the boss.}

# Regular dialogue
{300}{}{Hey, what do you want?}
{301}{}{Bye.}
{302}{}{Damn it, how could Kogan side with Lucas over us?! We've worked with him for years, but he doesn't give us any credit! I'm not going to stand for this. Someday we'll runs those sons of bitches out there!}
{303}{}{Great idea. I'm with you.}
{304}{}{Lucas runs the show here now. Get over it.}
{305}{}{Damn it! My people and I worked with Kogan for many years. Though he didn't treat us well, we trusted his leadership. Now Lucas comes and just takes over! This is some bullshit.}
