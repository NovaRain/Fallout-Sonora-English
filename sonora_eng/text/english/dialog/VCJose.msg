{100}{}{You see Jose.}
{101}{}{You see your uncle. He's trying to keep up his usual cheerful front, but it's not working so well this time.}
{102}{}{Not your best day, Jose.}
{103}{}{You've added a new quest to your Pip-Boy.}
{104}{}{Santo cielo! Why do you have to sneak up on me like that? That armor of yours doesn't belong in our peaceful Villa.}
{105}{}{You're haunted by the demons of the wasteland. Leave the village. Leave us in peace.}
{1105}{}{You're haunted by the demons of the wasteland. Leave the village. Leave us in peace.}

# First Dialogue
{200}{}{Ah, mi querido amigo, I'm so glad fate left you with us! Ay, ay, ay, those cursed raiders. You're lucky you weren't here.}
{201}{}{Uncle Jose... tell me what happened.}
{202}{}{E-eh, those devils swarmed us when we least expected. Some were grabbed right away, while others managed to hide in their homes. Your padre and the men took cover in the town hall. They had to be dragged out by force. The gunfight was no joke. The bodies are still lying around; no one to bury them.}
{203}{}{Tell me more.}
{204}{}{Then they rounded everyone up in the plaza. They sized each person up like they were bags of corn. The strong ones were taken aside, the rest were driven back into their homes and locked up.}
{205}{}{What happened next?}

{206}{}{The raiders didn't go to sleep - they looted the Villa and drank half the night. In the morning, they took our people and headed east into the wasteland. It's been quiet since then. We're just licking our wounds.}
{207}{}{Who were these raiders?}
{208}{}{You said they went east. Anywhere specific?}
{209}{}{Why did they take our people?}
{210}{}{Well, I guess it's time for me to deal with this.}
{211}{}{They were a mixed bunch from all over. I recognized a few from Garage City, but most were strangers.}
{212}{}{I only know of Garage City in that direction. The raiders will probably stop there for the night.}
{213}{}{Well, they didn't share their plans with old Jose. But you know what, they'll likely put our people to work. Don't know where or why, though.}
{214}{}{And my parents?}
{215}{}{Sorry, but they took them. Only the old folks and kids were left behind.}
{216}{}{Let's get serious, Jose. I need to know what really happened here.}
{217}{}{Bastards!}

{220}{}{Now that's the spirit of a true valiente guerrero! What will you do now? Start tracking the raiders? They're long gone.}
{221}{}{What do you think?}
{222}{}{First, tell me again about the raid.}
{223}{}{Well, first head to Garage City. It's a nasty place, but the raiders will definitely pass through there. Ask the locals, their tongues loosen up when you grease them a little.}
{224}{}{Grease them?}
{225}{}{You know, booze. But be careful with those folks, they'd sell their own mother for profit. Here, take some fruits and cornmeal for the road. For things like these, they'll tell you something.}
{226}{}{Thanks, Jose.}
{227}{}{Don't mention it. The raiders took everything they could find. I'm giving you my last. Use it wisely.}
{228}{}{That's it? Well, thanks, I guess.}
{229}{}{Hey, the raiders took everything they could find. I'm giving you my last. Use it wisely.}
{230}{}{That's not enough, Jose. I need more.}
{231}{}{Would you leave your dear old uncle without food? Fine, take some more. But that's all I can give you. The raiders took everything they could find.}
{232}{}{The raiders took everything they could find. I'm giving you my last. Use it wisely.}
{233}{}{Looks like I'll have to figure the rest out on my own. Adios, Uncle Jose!}
{234}{}{Alright.}

{240}{}{Thank the heavens, you're back and you brought the others with you!}
{1240}{}{Thank the heavens, you're back and you brought the others with you!}
{241}{}{Yeah, it was no easy journey. You know, there's a big world out there beyond the Villa. No one ever told me about it.}
{242}{}{Best to keep that to yourself, amigo. Outsiders have their truth, and we have ours. We'll never see eye to eye, which is why we live apart. No one can corrupt us, no one can force their rules on us. You've seen what that raid did. We can't let something like that happen again, right?}
{243}{}{I'll think about your words, Jose.}

# Repeated Dialogue
{250}{}{Good to see you, amigo.}
{251}{}{Amigo, don't just stand around. Find something to do, okay?}
{252}{}{I gotta go.}

{253}{}{I have a few questions... No, many questions.}
{254}{}{Ask anything you want.}
{255}{}{What do you know about the world beyond the Villa?}
{256}{}{What's the story with Villa's cellars?}
{257}{}{Wanna come with me?}
{258}{}{}
{259}{}{I have another question.}

{260}{}{Wild desert wastelands. Cannibal savages to the north, a junk city to the east, and a few small villages and Ranger outposts. There's also talk of a big city, but I've never been further than Garage City.}
{261}{}{Why do you call the surroundings wild?}
{262}{}{We've been avoiding outsiders for years. Only when we're in dire need do we trade with them. You can't trust outsiders, they usually have no families or homes. How can you make friends with such people? That's why your padre drove all the outsiders away.}
{263}{}{It seems our knowledge of the outside world is quite limited. Don't you think?}
{264}{}{Aren't raiders and cannibal savages enough? And marauders? No, we keep our distance for a reason. In the wasteland, people don't live. They survive.}
{265}{}{Tell me about the savages.}
{266}{}{Jackals, we call them. They're so wild they barely even know human language. And it's said they're all cannibals. Luckily, we're too tough for them to handle, but the scavengers from the nearby city often talked about them, with fear. So definitely steer clear of those savages.}
{267}{}{Who are the Rangers?}
{268}{}{Tough, cocky guys. They say they protect us from evildoers, but who knows what they're really up to? They come around sometimes to show off, but we manage without their help... though, you know, right now we could really use some help.}
{269}{}{Has anyone been further than Garage City?}
{270}{}{Your Uncle Miguel, for example. He had a falling out with your padre and left the Villa. We haven't heard from him in years.}
{271}{}{What was their falling out?}
{272}{}{They argued about how the Villa should deal with outsiders. One thought they should be driven away, the other suggested doing business with them. They never found common ground. Though, both had valid points.}

{273}{}{Tell me about the neighboring city.}
{274}{}{Garage City? It's a nasty town with nasty people.}
{275}{}{What kind of people live there?}
{276}{}{Scavengers. That's what they call themselves. They wander through ruins looking for anything valuable. Be careful with them - they're all crooks and they smell bad.}
{277}{}{Where could Miguel have gone?}
{278}{}{He mentioned wanting to visit that big city from the legends. But I'm afraid he found nothing but death in the sands.}
{279}{}{How do you know about Garage City?}
{280}{}{Hey, I'm the main trader with outsiders here in the Villa. Who else would know? Caravans sometimes come from there, we exchange a few words and part peacefully.}
{281}{}{What's the Villa's relationship with the Garage?}
{282}{}{Your padre hasn't told you, has he? Bad people live there. But we have to trade with them. We give them food, and they give us tools and repair services. That's the extent of our "relationship."}
{283}{}{It sounds like you don't like that city.}
{284}{}{You know old Jose - treat me kindly, and I'll treat you the same. But those folks, they cheat, try to rob, or say something rude. And they think poorly of us too. They're jealous that we live better than they do.}
{285}{}{}
{286}{}{}
{287}{}{(shakes his head sadly) Ay, amigo, the wasteland's really done a number on you, hasn't it? Does it hurt? Well, you made it here, that's what matters. Don't worry - we're family, we stick together.}
{288}{}{Thanks, Jose. I'll manage with this skin somehow.}
{289}{}{Problem, smoothskin? I don't need your pity, so better shut up.}

{290}{}{What are you talking about? We store grain there. Ah, grandma Adonisia filled your head with those old tales, didn't she? Ha-ha, forget it, there's nothing there.}
{291}{}{Then how do you explain this jumpsuit and wrist computer?}
{292}{}{Hmm? Found them under the town hall, did you? Well, then talk to your padre. Jose knows nothing.}
{1292}{}{Hmm? Found them under the town hall, did you? Well, then talk to your padre. Jose knows nothing.}
{293}{}{Come on Uncle Jose, you know something.}
{294}{}{Hey, amigo, drop it! I'm just a trader with a bad leg, they don't share secrets with me. Yes, I know that your padre had a secret stash in the cellar. And that it held family heirlooms, but it's none of my business, you understand?}
{295}{}{I'd follow you anywhere, but with this bad leg and my age, I won't make it far. Don't be upset, you'll manage on your own. I believe in you. After all, we're family, right?}
{296}{}{Jose, you don't look too happy.}
{297}{}{Huh?}
{298}{}{Well, it's just... so much has happened... Ah, never mind, forget it.}
{299}{}{You're not happy, Jose. You can't be. People died, others were taken into slavery, the Villa is ruined... Stop pretending you're cheerful.}
{300}{}{(lip trembling) Amigo... Why do you say such things...}
{301}{}{Now go have a good cry...}
{302}{}{It's okay, uncle, just let your feelings out, don't hold them in...}
{303}{}{What do you mean?}

#Quests
{310}{}{Is there anything I can do before I leave?}
{311}{}{Want to help rebuild the Villa? We'll manage somehow, your task is more important.}
{312}{}{Anything else?}
{313}{}{There are some outsiders, marauders probably, lurking out on the plantations. It'd be good to drive them away.}
{314}{}{Anything else?}
{315}{}{Also, the raiders damaged the weather station. It needs repairs. There might be parts in Garage City.}
{316}{}{Is that all?}
{317}{}{That's all I can think of.}
{318}{}{The marauders on the plantations are no longer a problem.}
{319}{}{You did it! Things might have turned out bad, without your help. The Villa's lucky to have you.}
{320}{}{Goodbye.}
{321}{}{The weather station is all fixed up.}
{322}{}{Great news! Without you, we wouldn't have managed the repairs. Thank you.}
{323}{}{Goodbye.}

#Gambling
{350}{}{Uncle Jose, I know you love gambling. Wanna play?}
{351}{}{What! You need to save our people! Once they're back in the Villa, I'd be happy to shake the dice with you.}
{352}{}{Then let's forget about games for now and talk about something else.}
{353}{}{Of course, you're right, I should hurry.}
{354}{}{Don't tell me what to do. Anyway, I don't feel like playing anymore.}
{355}{}{Well, now that our people are back, I could use a bit of fun. Just remember, I won't be going easy on you.}
{356}{}{Excellent, get the board and set up the dice...}
{357}{}{Hmm, it might be better not to play. Let's just chat instead.}
{358}{}{You know, now's not the best time. We'll do it later.}
{359}{}{You just beat one of the Villa's best players, and you've improved your skills.}
{360}{}{ }
{361}{}{You lost. Well, it's not the first time, and it won't be the last.}
