{100}{}{You see old man Hidalgo.}
{101}{}{You see one of the elders of the community.}
{102}{}{You're our hero and savior. We love and appreciate you.}
{1102}{}{You're our heroine and savior. We love and appreciate you.}
{103}{}{Everyone will be better off if you leave the Villa. And you should never come back here again.}
{104}{}{Good journey to the son of Andres and Maria. Don't forget your roots.}
{1104}{}{Good journey to the daughter of Andres and Maria. Don't forget your roots.}
{105}{}{What kind of joke is this? Go away, steel demon!}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{(Before you stands Old Man Hidalgo; as usual, he's half-asleep, chewing on something.)}
{201}{}{Ahem. Old man, you wanted to see me?}
{202}{}{Ahh... }
{203}{}{...Hrrm... wh... uh... mm... here...}
{204}{}{Look, if you stop chewing that tobacco, I might actually hear what you're saying.}
{205}{}{(He spits and wipes his mouth with a bony hand.) I'm saying... the community wants you at the gathering. We figured it's time for you to throw in your two cents.}
{206}{}{What gathering?}
{207}{}{We got decisions to make. Savin' our people ain't the end of our struggles, amigo.}
{208}{}{When's the gathering?}
{209}{}{Tonight, when the sun's down and the day's work is done. We old-timers like to take our time, so don't expect it to wrap up quick.}
{210}{}{I'll be there on time. See you then.}
{211}{}{Alright, I'll make sure to be there.}
{212}{}{Might as well wait here. How about a game of dice to kill the time?}
{213}{}{I'll wait around. No need to hurry.}

{220}{}{, you remember about the gathering?}
{221}{}{Yeah, I'll be there on time.}
{222}{}{It's evening. Time to get started.}
{223}{}{How about a game of dice while we wait?}
{224}{}{I'll wait right here.}
{225}{}{You're late. Everyone's already asleep.}
{226}{}{Hr-r-r... snrk... khhr-khhr-khhr...}
{227}{}{He's fast asleep. No use trying to wake him now...}

# First meeting
{250}{}{As you've all seen, hard times are upon us.}
{251}{}{[Continue]}
{252}{}{Beyond the valley, there's a world we never imagined. Outsiders have caught wind of our plantations. Sooner or later, thieves and traders alike will come to take a slice of what we've got.}
{253}{}{[Continue]}
{254}{}{We must prepare for their arrival. Remember how easily those raiders stormed our village and took everyone captive? Even Señor Andres couldn't fend them off in the town hall. (The hall fills with murmurs of anger.)}
{255}{}{[Continue]}
{256}{}{Quiet now. We're all on edge, but not all is lost. We've returned from our ordeal, our homes still stand, and soon the plantations will bear fruit again. We still have some time.}
{257}{}{[Continue]}
{258}{}{(A voice from the crowd: "Old man, what can we do? The first raiders that come by will squeeze us dry like a ripe mutfruit.") I know, I know... quiet down! It's not as bad as it seems. }
{259}{}{, come up here. Step closer, sit right here...}
{260}{}{[Step forward]}
{261}{}{Here stands our savior. }
{1261}{}{Here stands our savior. }
{262}{}{ helped free all of you from the chains of slavery. Now he'll help protect our families from outsiders...}
{1262}{}{ helped free all of you from the chains of slavery. Now she'll help protect our families from outsiders...}
{263}{}{Hey folks, how's it going?}
{264}{}{Good to see you all.}
{1264}{}{Good to see you all.}
{265}{}{}
{266}{}{(A grumbling rises from the crowd, and a villager stands: "Hey, old man, stop propping up the boy. We'd have gotten out of that mess on our own. The whole community knows he's not fit to lead. This doesn't change that.") Quiet! I know many of you don't like }
{1266}{}{(A grumbling rises from the crowd, and a villager stands: "Hey, old man, stop propping up the girl. We'd have gotten out of that mess on our own. The whole community knows she's not fit to lead. This doesn't change that.") Quiet! I know many of you don't like }
{267}{}{, but what would you have done without his help? Besides, that's not what we're here to discuss.}
{1267}{}{, but what would you have done without her help? Besides, that's not what we're here to discuss.}
{268}{}{Don't mind them. They're just intimidated by me.}
{269}{}{It's fine, old man. Let's not make this about me, alright?}
{270}{}{(A villager stands: "I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm grateful to you, }
{271}{}{. Many of us think you're a worthy heir to your padre.") You hear that, }
{1271}{}{. Many of us think you're a worthy heir to your padre.") You hear that, }
{272}{}{? Cherish the trust you've earned.}
{273}{}{I understand. You can count on me.}
{274}{}{Damn right. I'll whip this place into shape.}
{275}{}{(Another villager rises: "Old man, we're thankful, sure, but you know as well as anyone, we don't have time for hero worship. }
{276}{}{ did what he was supposed to do. Can we leave it at that for now?") You're right. But don't forget who got you out of that prison.}
{1276}{}{ did what she was supposed to do. Can we leave it at that for now?") You're right. But don't forget who got you out of that prison.}
{277}{}{Friends, let's continue.}
{278}{}{Well, that's gratitude for you. Typical.}

{280}{}{The thing is, slavery and that long trek through the desert have really taken a toll on Señor Andres. He can't stray too far from the Villa now and is barely managing the village's recovery. }
{281}{}{, you're going to have to take on some of his duties. It's time you start carrying the responsibility your padre once did.}
{282}{}{Of course. I've been preparing for this my whole life.}
{1282}{}{Of course. I've been preparing for this my whole life.}
{283}{}{Is this some kind of joke? Hey, padre, what's going on?}
{284}{}{I'm also sorry to share some sad news. Señor Andres, your savior's father, died during his imprisonment. (a gasp ripples through the crowd) According to our community's rules, his rightful heir will take his place. }
{285}{}{, you're now our leader.}
{286}{}{Of course. I've been preparing for this my whole life.}
{1286}{}{Of course. I've been preparing for this my whole life.}
{287}{}{Wow. Just like that, huh?}

{290}{}{Your madre would be proud of you. It's a shame she's no longer with us. (the crowd falls into a respectful silence, removing their hats)}
{291}{}{Don't take it too hard, folks. She wouldn't want that.}
{292}{}{Just so you know, none of this was my fault. Keep that in mind.}
{293}{}{Your madre has already approved the passing of leadership. She's busy with the village recovery, which means you, }
{294}{}{, will need to handle everything else.}
{295}{}{I can handle it.}
{296}{}{Finally, people are starting to take me seriously.}

{300}{}{(Old man Pablo stands up from the crowd) It's too soon to let this kid run the Villa! Don't make us laugh, Hidalgo! (a villager stands up) This ain't the time to worry about that! Tell us how to deal with the slavers! (another villager shouts) Have you heard what's happening with those scavengers from the nearby town? This could mean the end of our peaceful life!}
{1300}{}{(Old man Pablo stands up from the crowd) It's too soon to let this girl run the Villa! Don't make us laugh, Hidalgo! (a villager stands up) This ain't the time to worry about that! Tell us how to deal with the slavers! (another villager shouts) Have you heard what's happening with those scavengers from the nearby town? This could mean the end of our peaceful life!}
{301}{}{Calm down, folks!}
{302}{}{This is turning into a bit of circus...}
{303}{}{(The hall buzzes with murmurs until Hidalgo raises his hand) Quiet! Enough with the noise! We'll get to it, but one at a time, por favor.}
{304}{}{, it's your turn to speak.}
{305}{}{Old man Pablo is as suspicious as ever. I'll have to address his complaints.}
{306}{}{The slavers. That's the most important issue right now.}
{307}{}{Garage City is a cesspool, but what's the problem with the scavengers?}

{310}{}{"Hey, Pablo, isn't saving the village enough for you? What more do you want?" - "Shut up, Hidalgo. Let the kid answer. Running the Villa isn't the same as running from slavers."}
{311}{}{What else will you surprise us old folks with?}
{312}{}{Saving the village should be enough for you to trust me. It's time for the old guard to step aside.}
{313}{}{Old man Pablo, your constant griping is getting on my nerves. I've said what I needed to say.}
{1313}{}{Old man Pablo, your constant griping is getting on my nerves. I've said what I needed to say.}
{314}{}{That's enough.}
{315}{}{This is what I'm talking about - recklessness! The young don't understand what it means to lead a community. They don't know the rules, nor our history. Can we really trust someone like that with our legacy? (general discontent)}
{316}{}{[More]}
{317}{}{But in the end, it'll be everyone's decision. I've said my piece.}
{318}{}{Hmm... Now I see who I'm dealing with. You care about our people and our village. You can be trusted. But only if you listen to us old-timers. (turning to the crowd) I approve! (the crowd erupts in cheers)}
{319}{}{[More]}
{320}{}{While you were gone, I fixed the weather station that the raiders had destroyed.}
{1320}{}{While you were gone, I fixed the weather station that the raiders had destroyed.}
{321}{}{What? Oh, the weather station... Was that really the priority while our people were in trouble? Though, granted, the station is important, especially now with our food reserves running low. Still, people were in trouble.}
{322}{}{Jose definitely wouldn't have managed it with his bad leg.}
{323}{}{Well, I also chased off some scavengers. They were trying to take the last remnants of our harvest.}
{1323}{}{Well, I also chased off some scavengers. They were trying to take the last remnants of our harvest.}
{324}{}{And they succeeded, didn't they? You took the flour from the barn and gave it to them. (the crowd voices their outrage)}
{1324}{}{And they succeeded, didn't they? You took the flour from the barn and gave it to them. (the crowd voices their outrage)}
{325}{}{But they left without hurting anyone. And that's the most important thing!}
{326}{}{Yes. And that was the right decision.}
{327}{}{That's good. We're rationing every grain now. Although the scavengers wouldn't have taken much anyway. And we would've driven them off, in due time.}
{328}{}{That's just idle speculation.}
{329}{}{Come on. While you were gathering your courage, they would've broken into the barn and taken everything in it. You should say "thank you," you ungrateful lot.}
{330}{}{I treated the wounded from the raid.}
{1330}{}{I treated the wounded from the raid.}
{331}{}{We all know how that went. The Founder forbade those old remedies for a reason - they're dangerous. Half of them are poison. Even if not, the descendants of those you treated might be cursed. Reckless, but I admit, people are alive because of you.}
{332}{}{It had to be done. Lives come first.}
{333}{}{To hell with your 'Old World' taboos!}
{334}{}{People are alive because of you. And they'll help rebuild the village. Thank you. But you should have focused on rescuing those who were enslaved first.}
{335}{}{As you can see, I managed both tasks.}
{336}{}{You're impossible to please, old man.}
{337}{}{Little Eden almost got into trouble. I barely pulled him out from a pack of coyotes that had been roaming the plantation.}
{338}{}{We know about that. It was brave, no doubt about it. Though, I don't think he really needed help. He could've survived on corn leaves for a while and eventually returned to the village out of hunger. The kid's not stupid.}
{339}{}{I don't it would have turned out like that.}
{340}{}{That's just idle speculation from a grumpy old man.}

{350}{}{(Another voice from the crowd) Hold on, old man. We ain't even mentioned Chris yet. That bastard was a traitor and deserved a good flogging. But thanks to }
{351}{}{, Chris got away! Now who knows what kind of trouble he's stirring up in the Wasteland, spilling our secrets.}
{352}{}{Uh, listen...}
{353}{}{Yeah, it's a real mess. How could you let that happen, }
{354}{}{? If a man turns on his people, there's only one way to handle it - hard and fast. Your soft heart ain't fit for leading. What do you have to say for yourself, }
{355}{}{?}
{356}{}{I followed my conscience.}
{1356}{}{I followed my conscience.}
{357}{}{You see. Now, because of your so-called conscience, the whole village is at risk! (the crowd stirs, anger building)}
{358}{}{Come on...}
{359}{}{I can't believe you were planning to flog a fellow villager.}
{360}{}{Friends and family should look out for each other. It's you who deserve a "flogging" for your attitude towards Chris. Shame on you.}
{361}{}{(The hall falls silent, embarrassed) Well... It's debatable. Maybe I should keep quiet on this one.}
{362}{}{Exactly.}
{363}{}{(Another voice rises from the crowd) Wait a minute, old man. Don't forget how }
{364}{}{ went after Chris and brought him back. Chris was a traitor and earned his stripes, but if not for }
{1364}{}{ went after Chris and brought him back. Chris was a traitor and earned his stripes, but if not for }
{365}{}{, he would've slipped away for good. Who knows what he'd spill to outsiders?}
{366}{}{[Continue]}
{367}{}{That's right. A leader can't afford to be weak. Traitors gotta be punished.}
{368}{}{[Continue]}

{370}{}{(A new voice pipes up) Hey! What about that scary iron thing }
{371}{}{ always stomps around in, frightening the kids? We don't need that kind of relic here!}
{372}{}{It's called Power Armor, and it keeps me alive.}
{373}{}{(Old Man Hidalgo stretches from his nap) They've got a point, }
{374}{}{. The Founder warned us against using Old World tech. It's what caused the Great War a century ago. We've stayed clear of that junk for good reason. Now you bring it in, acting like nothing's wrong.}
{375}{}{You're impossible to please.}
{376}{}{This armor has saved my life more than once. It might save the Villa too.}
{377}{}{Hmm... maybe you're right, but still - you shouldn't be scaring your own people. We've had enough trouble as it is.}
{378}{}{Fine...}
{379}{}{What's wrong with old tech if it protects us? It's nonsense.}
{380}{}{The Founder knew what that Old World tech could do! You think you're smarter than our ancestors? (the crowd boos: "Boo")}
{381}{}{You're impossible to please.}
{382}{}{(Another voice calls out) Hey! What about that metal beast }
{383}{}{ tears across the desert on, kicking up a sandstorm? That thing terrifies our kids. We don't need it!}
{384}{}{My motorcycle? Without it, it'd be a lot harder to travel long distances.}
{385}{}{(Hidalgo rises, gestures to the crowd) Anyone else got somethin' to say about our champion here? No more complaints? If that's the case, raise your hands if you agree to make }
{1385}{}{(Hidalgo rises, gestures to the crowd) Anyone else got somethin' to say about our champion here? No more complaints? If that's the case, raise your hands if you agree to make }
{386}{}{ the leader of the Villa.}
{387}{}{Well, here goes...}
{388}{}{I can't believe this is happening...}
{389}{}{The vote passes, overwhelmingly. Congratulations, }
{390}{}{.}
{391}{}{Phew, wasn't sure how that'd go...}
{392}{}{Exactly what I expected. All right, then.}
{393}{}{Less than half, but still, }
{394}{}{, you'll need to put in more work to earn all our trust. But by the Founder's decree, only his bloodline can lead. Delay won't change that.}
{395}{}{That's fine with me. No rush.}
{396}{}{You stubborn old fools, every last one of you.}

{400}{}{It seems we've dealt with all the most important issues. And now, I've got important things I need to do.}
{401}{}{Yes, indeed. We'll be waiting for your return. Good luck, }
{402}{}{. And may the winds be at your back.}
{403}{}{[Leave the meeting]}

{410}{}{(your madre rises) While I was working in the garrison, I overheard the mercenaries talking. They said the demand for slaves will only increase. There's no guarantee they won't come for us again.}
{411}{}{(a peasant rises) While I was working in the Flagstaff mines, I overheard the mercenaries talking. They said the demand for slaves will only increase. There's no guarantee they won't come for us again.}
{412}{}{[Next]}
{413}{}{(a peasant rises) }
{414}{}{(Sancho rises) }
{415}{}{You're right. We only escaped the pen. As long as the mines are operational, we won't be safe. I think we should destroy them.}
{416}{}{Destroy the mines? How do you propose we do that?}
{417}{}{In the mines, we used something called "explosives." They can 'explode' and bring down tons of rock. There should be enough of this stuff stored away near the mine to collapse the main passage.}
{418}{}{You're insane. Going back there for sabotage? It's way too dangerous.}
{419}{}{(Hidalgo chews his tobacco thoughtfully) Got a better idea? No? Then think on it and present your solution at the next meeting. But don't take too long.}
{420}{}{Fine.}
{421}{}{I like this idea. I'll blow those mines to kingdom come.}
{422}{}{(a general cheer of approval) Hurrah! Blow those diggers up! Do it!}
{423}{}{It's settled. I'll do it.}
{424}{}{Give me time to think. Perhaps I can find a compromise with the mine owner.}
{425}{}{(The room trades doubtful glances) You think so? Hmm. Well, for now, the Council leans toward sabotage. Make the right call.}
{426}{}{Alright.}
{427}{}{(Hugo rises) }

{430}{}{Traders brought rumors that scavengers in Garage City are fixing up an old factory, planning to produce machines. Imagine what that means for our Villa!}
{431}{}{[Next]}
{432}{}{Jose, tell them. (Jose rises) Yes, of course... }
{433}{}{We'll become a waypoint on caravan routes. Crowds of workers will pour in. Along with them will come raiders, weapons, and alcohol. We won't be able to resist such changes; we'll simply be swept away.}
{434}{}{You suggest we stop the restoration of the factory?}
{435}{}{If the factory's all about its machines, then we need to destroy the machines themselves. I don't know how to do that. But those who returned from Flagstaff speak of something called "explosives." Surely that stuff can destroy the machines if it can bring down mountains of rock. There's no need to destroy the entire factory.}
{436}{}{I have good relations with the scavengers. I wouldn't want to declare war on them.}
{437}{}{I don't know about declaring war on the scavengers. They're our neighbors!}
{438}{}{They're no friends of ours! They helped the raiders who enslaved us. How can you establish relations with such scum? In any case, we can't allow the factory to develop. If you have another option, do something. But no one will be cozying up to these rejects.}
{439}{}{Understood.}
{440}{}{For their betrayal of their neighbors, the scavengers deserve to be brought down a peg or two. I'll destroy their damned factory.}
{441}{}{(a general cheer of approval) Hurrah! Destroy it! Give those filthy scavengers what they deserve!}
{442}{}{You can count on me.}
{443}{}{You're trying to deprive people of their hard earned efforts. We should try to find a compromise.}
{444}{}{Compromise with the scavengers? They're cunning merchants and natural-born tricksters. The Council does not approve of such tactics.}
{445}{}{Fine, I'll consider other options.}

{450}{}{Hey, old man. I did it. The Flagstaff mines have been destroyed.}
{451}{}{Hm? Oh... So you managed it? Good. Well, let's hope for the best.}
{452}{}{Now it's time to deal with the factory in Garage City...}
{453}{}{I want to report that the Flagstaff mines are no longer a problem. They're using a robot now and cutting down on the number of slaves.}
{454}{}{A robot, you say? So - a machine from the Old World? Oh, that's not a good sign. Who knows how long it'll work, and whether Faber might have other plans? But the fact that he no longer needs slaves is good.}
{455}{}{Now I'll go deal with the factory in Garage City...}
{456}{}{I have news - the machine at the Garage City factory has been destroyed.}
{457}{}{Hm? Ah... Good news. No need to stir up that old demon. We were fine without the factory.}
{458}{}{Now it's time to deal with the Flagstaff prison...}
{459}{}{We don't need to destroy the machines in Garage City. The factory leader is offering favorable terms for Villa's restoration.}
{460}{}{Oh... What are you saying? You're proposing we form an alliance with scavengers? Many won't like that. On the other hand, their labor would be very helpful and would greatly benefit Villa.}
{461}{}{Now I'll go deal with the Flagstaff mine...}
{462}{}{So, both problems have been solved. Time to convene a new Council.}
{463}{}{(thinking for a long time, nodding in response) Alright... But now you will only speak with the elders.}
{464}{}{Uh, fine...}
{465}{}{}
{466}{}{, we are grateful to you for freeing us from our enemies. Old man Hidalgo told us that Garage City and Flagstaff are no longer a threat. After all, they were our closest and thus most dangerous foes.}
{467}{}{So, now we've got some breathing space.}
{468}{}{Oh no. I'm afraid not. You, your padre, and several other elders have traveled far from home. We know what the world can be like. Without protectors, we're an easy target for any raider.}
{469}{}{Then we need to find allies. Or become strong enough that others take us seriously.}
{470}{}{As you understand, our peasant traditions don't allow us to even touch old technology. We know how to cultivate but not how to fight. We need a protector. The only one who can take on that role is the Rangers. Go to them and negotiate with General Mossman for the protection of Villa in exchange for part of our harvest.}
{471}{}{So be it. I will carry out the Council's will.}
{472}{}{I don't like the idea of allies.}
{473}{}{Such is the will of the Council. We rely on you to carry it out.}
{474}{}{You can count on me.}
{475}{}{Pray that your will doesn't lead to our Villa's submission. Farewell.}
{476}{}{We have our ears, }
{477}{}{. Tell us how things stand with our enemies now.}

{480}{}{Have you spoken to the general of the Rangers yet? What was his response?}
{1480}{}{Have you spoken to the general of the Rangers yet? What was his response?}
{481}{}{I haven't managed to meet with him yet. But I'm still hopeful I can do it.}
{482}{}{Recently, an envoy from the Brotherhood of Steel arrived here. His arrogance and pride have already tired the villagers. We wanted to hear from you personally, what does this mean? What do they want?}
{483}{}{You were seeking a protector ally. Here they are. You won't find a better one.}
{484}{}{We know about the Brotherhood of Steel. Your padre learned of them when he was forced into slavery. He also said that if it weren't for the Brotherhood, there wouldn't be a Flagstaff colony, the Cult of Fire, or slavery in Two-Sun. Now you bring the beast into our lands and force us to work for them?}
{485}{}{To avoid being swallowed by the beast, we must befriend it. As long as we pay with our harvest, they won't harm us. Moreover, they'll help us with technology and protection.}
{486}{}{(heavy silence) You're the leader of the community now. It's up to you where to lead us. If you see the Villa's future this way, so be it. We won't be able to resist your will. Not anymore.}
{487}{}{Don't frame it that way. You're stuck in the past. The Villa has long needed change. And an alliance with the Brotherhood will be the beginning of something new. The key is not to miss this opportunity. Unfortunately, for the moment, I need to go.}
{488}{}{So, recently an envoy from the Rangers arrived. Was that your doing?}
{489}{}{Yes. The Rangers are ready to form an alliance to protect the Villa.}
{490}{}{Give me a moment. Before I explain things, I need to gather my thoughts...}
{491}{}{The Rangers act like they care about us. But in truth, they're only concerned with securing food. We won't let them overstep the bounds of the contract.}
{492}{}{While we're under their protection, we must strengthen our position, build up our power, so we can fend off enemies on our own.}
{493}{}{(silent agreement) This is your story to write for yourself and our future generations. You're the leader of the Villa; it's your choice where to lead it. We, the elders, don't have long left. But we're glad the Villa is in capable hands.}
{494}{}{The main thing is not to let ourselves be manipulated. Now, for the moment, I need to go.}
{495}{}{The Rangers can't form an alliance with us. They've been defeated.}
{496}{}{I haven't been able to work things out with the Rangers. In fact, I think they want to kill me.}
{497}{}{In that case, we are doomed. On our own, we won't be able to defend ourselves from our enemies.}
{498}{}{But Flagstaff and Garage City...}
{499}{}{You know very well that they were merely the outskirts of a bigger problem. Those who hold the fate of Sonora in their hands are still firmly entrenched in the south. And they won't give up what's theirs.}
{500}{}{Who are you talking about?}
{501}{}{Your padre told us that the Tinsmiths and Fire Cultists were mere puppets of the Brotherhood of Steel. Find this Brotherhood and stop them before it's too late. And don't return to the Villa until you've done so.}
{502}{}{Alright. I'll do it.}
{503}{}{You old fools. You've completely lost it.}
{504}{}{Are you talking about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{505}{}{The Tinsmiths and Fire Cultists were mere puppets of the Brotherhood of Steel. Find this Brotherhood and stop them before it's too late. And don't return to the Villa until you've done so.}
{506}{}{I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's ship. Its voyage has come to an end.}
{1506}{}{I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's ship. Its voyage has come to an end.}
{507}{}{Truly, a hero among heroes! Without the Brotherhood of Steel and the Rangers, the big cities will descend into chaos and won't be able to thrive.}
{1507}{}{Truly, you are the protector of our lands! Without the Brotherhood of Steel and the Rangers, the big cities will descend into chaos and won't be able to thrive.}
{508}{}{This is our chance to rise up, to become strong enough to fend off our enemies in the future.}
{509}{}{Now we see that the Villa is in good hands. You're a true leader, and the future of our people lies secure with you.}
{510}{}{The key is to avoid being manipulated. Now, for the moment, I need to go.}
{511}{}{This is very bad. If the Rangers are now our enemies, we'll have to find another ally.}
{512}{}{Alright. I'll try to find another ally for us.}
{513}{}{Maybe I can sabotage their dam to make them back off, at least for a while.}
