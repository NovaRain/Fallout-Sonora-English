
PERSONAL BIO DATA:

The most talented yet
most headstrong of the
Villa residents. Salma,
from an early age, was
passionate about
knowledge and pre-war
technology. However, her
community views her
interests skeptically,
preferring she stick to
traditional women's
roles like herbalism,
upbringing, and
housekeeping. At best,
she could hope to be a
teacher. Now is her
time to prove the value
of her skills.
