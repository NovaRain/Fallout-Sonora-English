{100}{}{You see Young.}
{101}{}{You see a boy, about five years old.}
{102}{}{When I grow up, I'm going to wear armor like this too!}
{103}{}{Stay back! I'll defend myself!}

{200}{}{Hey there, I haven't seen you around before.}
{201}{}{And you won't see me again. Goodbye.}
{202}{}{Of course you haven't, I'm straight from the wasteland.}
{203}{}{You live in the desert? That's weird. What's your name?}
{204}{}{Name yourself first.}
{205}{}{My name is }
{206}{}{. And you?}
{207}{}{Hey kid, what's your name?}
{208}{}{State your name, squirt.}
{209}{}{My name is Young, sir.}
{1209}{}{My name is Young, ma'am.}
{210}{}{That's a strong name, Young. It's unique.}
{211}{}{My parents gave it to me. I don't know why.}
{212}{}{What kind of fools gave you that name?}
{213}{}{My parents named me that. And they're not fools. They're better than strangers like you.}
{214}{}{Where are your parents, by the way?}
{215}{}{Around here somewhere. Paladin Latham is my dad. Mom's probably by the shore, doing the laundry.}
{216}{}{Your mom washes the paladins' underpants?}
{217}{}{She's not a paladin. She doesn't have a rank at all.}
{218}{}{Is your mom a paladin too?}
{219}{}{No way, sir. She has no rank.}
{1219}{}{No way, ma'am. She has no rank.}
{220}{}{Wait, so you're the son of a paladin and a commoner? Is that even allowed?}
{221}{}{My dad's the best! He can do anything!}
{222}{}{Interesting customs you have here.}

{250}{}{Oh, hey.}
{251}{}{Young boy reporting for duty!}
{252}{}{Are you really with the Brotherhood?}
{253}{}{What's your rank?}
{254}{}{}
{255}{}{Goodbye, young man.}

{260}{}{Remind me again, who the hell are you?}
{261}{}{I'm Young. My dad's a paladin, and my mom's a commoner. Got it now?}
{262}{}{Got it.}
{263}{}{What are you doing on this ship?}
{264}{}{All sorts of things. They're always giving me tasks. Fetch this, carry that.}
{265}{}{I see.}
{266}{}{What are you doing right now?}
{267}{}{I'm looking for my toy. He's small, has four legs. If you find him, bring him back to me, okay?}
{268}{}{I'm not in the mood for games right now.}
{269}{}{I could help you search. Where did you last see him?}
{270}{}{I've been running all over the ship. I don't know where he could be.}
{271}{}{Alright. That gives me a start.}
{272}{}{Is this the toy you've been looking for?}
{273}{}{Yes! That's it!}
{274}{}{Here you go. And try not to lose it again.}
{275}{}{Thank you, sir...}
{1275}{}{Thank you, ma'am...}
{276}{}{You're welcome.}
{277}{}{In the wasteland, we usually get paid for work. What can you give me in return?}
{278}{}{(hesitantly pulls a magnetic card from his pocket)}
{279}{}{A magnetic door key? That's it? Alright, come here.}

{280}{}{Get out of here. Things are about to get real hot.}
{281}{}{What do you mean, sir?}
{1281}{}{What do you mean, ma'am?}
{282}{}{Don't waste time! If you don't want to get hurt, hide in the ruins.}
{283}{}{Just kidding. Haha. Never mind.}
{284}{}{*whimpering*}
{285}{}{Th...thank you...}
