{200}{}{Good afternoon.}
{201}{}{After you, please.}
{202}{}{*Gives you a friendly wave*}
{203}{}{Of course, of course, I wouldn't dream of holding you up.}
{204}{}{Anything I can help with?}
{205}{}{I'd buy you a drink, but I'm flat broke.}
{206}{}{Hey, how's it going?}
{207}{}{We need more folks like you around here.}
{208}{}{Not sure why, but people say good things about you.}
{209}{}{My respects to you.}

{210}{}{Hello there.}
{211}{}{Watch where you're walking.}
{212}{}{Ugh, damn tourists...}
{213}{}{Don't bother me, or you'll catch a fist to the face.}
{214}{}{You're not from around here, are you?}
{215}{}{First time in Phoenix?}
{216}{}{*Waves you off dismissively*}
{217}{}{Great, another beggar.}
{218}{}{Quit bugging me.}
{219}{}{What do you want?}

{220}{}{Get lost.}
{221}{}{Move it.}
{222}{}{Out of the way.}
{223}{}{When they hang you, I'll be laughing.}
{224}{}{Another peasant rushing into the city, huh?}
{225}{}{Running out of space in the wasteland, are you?}
{226}{}{Stay away from me.}
{227}{}{You don't belong in Phoenix.}
{228}{}{You'll be hanging soon enough.}
{229}{}{The city would be better off without you.}

{230}{}{Don't touch me, Iron Man!}
{231}{}{Hi, uh... sir? Or ma'am? Whoever you are.}
{232}{}{Can I ride on your shoulders?}
{233}{}{Mind taking care of a couple enemies for me?}
{234}{}{You looking for other robots like yourself?}
{235}{}{Not many robots left around here if that's what you're after.}
{236}{}{Kinda sad, huh? A robot all alone in a human world.}
{237}{}{*Knock knock* Anyone in there?}
{238}{}{Sorry, Scarecrow and Toto aren't around.}
{239}{}{Need a little oiling up, big guy?}

#- GG follower

{243}{}{Glory to the Holy Fire... So, uh, what now?}
{244}{}{Okay, okay, I'll stop breathing YOUR air.}
{245}{}{I honor Aaron, our savior.}
{246}{}{How do I become an acolyte?}
{247}{}{I don't want any trouble, I swear.}
{248}{}{Wait, is it true you're not allowed to, you know... have fun?}
{249}{}{Don't ask me for donations-I'm broke.}

#- GG arena champion
{250}{}{I would've bought you a drink, but my bet on the last fight tanked.}
{251}{}{Damn, if only you'd lost, I'd be rolling in caps.}
{252}{}{I'll just step aside... and maybe leave town.}
{253}{}{You don't really look like a champion.}
{254}{}{How long did it take you to train?}
{255}{}{If you lose the next one, I'll be SO mad.}
{256}{}{I'll bring my kids to your next fight.}
{257}{}{That was one hell of a fight, champ.}
{258}{}{Why aren't you in the ring anymore?}
{259}{}{Fights are boring without you in the arena.}

{1250}{}{I would've bought you a drink, but my last bet was a bust.}
{1251}{}{Damn, if you'd lost, I'd be swimming in caps.}
{1252}{}{Excuse me, I'll just step aside... and maybe out of town.}
{1253}{}{You don't look like a champion to me.}
{1254}{}{How long did you train for that?}
{1255}{}{If you lose the next one, I'll be seriously upset.}
{1256}{}{I'll bring my kids to your next battle.}
{1257}{}{That was a great fight, champ.}
{1258}{}{Why aren't you fighting in the ring anymore?}
{1259}{}{Fights have gotten dull without you around.}

#- GG is high
{260}{}{Yeah, yeah, leprechauns are just around the corner... sure.}
{261}{}{Are you high?}
{262}{}{I've had problems with that stuff too.}
{263}{}{I don't have any drugs for you, sorry.}
{264}{}{Get lost, junkie.}
{265}{}{I feel bad for people like you.}
{266}{}{Are you okay?}
{267}{}{You seem like you're having a good time... judging by those pupils.}
{268}{}{This isn't gonna end well.}
{269}{}{Looking for drugs? Try the slums, loser.}

#- about the city
{270}{}{This sky's never gonna clear up, is it?}
{271}{}{Feels like it's gonna be a scorcher tonight.}
{272}{}{East winds only bring dust and ash, nothing good.}
{273}{}{Always so damn smoggy here.}
{274}{}{Dust storm season's creeping up.}

{275}{}{I can't stand this town anymore.}
{276}{}{I've been stuck here way too long.}
{277}{}{City's getting way too crowded these days.}
{278}{}{Time to get the hell outta here.}
{279}{}{Phoenix is packed... and full of headaches.}

{280}{}{Seems like luck's finally run out on me.}
{281}{}{I'm gonna clean up at the casino tonight.}
{282}{}{Trying to stop, but... can't resist.}
{283}{}{Tonight's gonna be a blast!}
{284}{}{Think I'll try my luck at the tables.}

{285}{}{I can't wait to catch another one of Veronica's shows.}
{286}{}{Veronica's got quite the figure on her.}
{287}{}{Another day down the drain.}
{288}{}{If you're bored, hit up the ring.}
{289}{}{Years without a drop of rain.}

{290}{}{Heard the mercs are prepping a new batch of slaves.}
{291}{}{That casino's crawling with crooks.}
{292}{}{Street thugs have totally lost control.}
{293}{}{The slums? That's a death sentence.}
{294}{}{Caravanners everywhere you look these days...}

{330}{}{Oh no, it's looking right at me!}
{331}{}{You think it's here to attack someone?}

{333}{}{That thing gives me the creeps.}

{335}{}{So, this is the legendary Power Armor, huh?}
{336}{}{I hope that thing isn't radioactive.}

{344}{}{Staring at the Followers? Bad idea.}
{345}{}{Is that a Follower? Better say something nice...}
{346}{}{Those Followers have spies all over the place.}

{354}{}{Hey, great match, champ!}
{355}{}{*whistles* Yo! Champ!}

{380}{}{The bank finally took pity on me.}
{381}{}{I'm never stepping foot in a casino again.}
{382}{}{I'll hit the casino for just an hour... maybe two.}
{383}{}{Luck's turned its back on me.}
{384}{}{Everything's been against me lately.}

{385}{}{If the Followers preach at me one more time...}
{386}{}{Even in daylight, the slums are dangerous.}

#- explosion of the Cathedral

{393}{}{I don't know which is worse, life with the Followers or without them.}
{394}{}{I can't believe it was a nuke.}
{395}{}{So those bastards were really building a nuke?}
{396}{}{A nuclear bomb? Yeah, they were definitely insane.}
{397}{}{After the Cathedral explosion, caps started losing their value.}
