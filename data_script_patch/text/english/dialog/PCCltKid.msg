{100}{}{You see a child.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary city kid in rags.}
{102}{}{Uh, I gotta go.}

{200}{}{Sorry, sir!}
{1200}{}{Sorry, ma'am!}
{201}{}{I don't deal with beggars. Get lost.}
{202}{}{What do you want, kid?}
{203}{}{I was asked to give this to you. (holds out a note)}
{204}{}{If this is some kind of trick, you'll regret it.}
{205}{}{Thanks, kid, give it here.}
{206}{}{Come here.}
{207}{}{(The child passes the note and immediately runs away. You unfold the paper: "The cultists got what they deserved. Stop your investigation, or you'll meet the same fate.")}
{208}{}{If that kid didn't write this, then I should be shaking in fear.}
{209}{}{Looks like more than just ordinary thugs are behind the attacks.}
