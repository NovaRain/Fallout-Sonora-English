{100}{}{You see a Ranger.}
{101}{}{You see a Ranger at his post. He's protecting the entrance to the dam.}
#Pass Inside
{110}{}{If you wanna get in, talk to Jack.}  
{111}{}{Jack's the one who decides if someone like you gets in or not.}  
{112}{}{Trying to get inside? Tell Jack about it.}  
{113}{}{I don't have the clearance to let you through.}  
{114}{}{Beat it. This ain't a spot for sightseeing.}  
{115}{}{Get inside and quit bugging me.}  
{116}{}{You've got clearance. What else do you need?}  
{117}{}{We're not running a tourist attraction here.}  
{118}{}{Wanna see the dam? Then go see it.}  
{119}{}{Don't bother a guard when he's on duty.}  

#Ranger Title
{120}{}{Don't even think about distracting me while I'm on duty.}  
{121}{}{Looking for advice? Move along, and don't drag your feet.}  
{122}{}{Rangers could teach a rookie like you a thing or two.}  
{123}{}{We don't care for folks who stand around yawning without a purpose.}  
{124}{}{If you sign up as a cadet, the commander will knock that nonsense right out of you.}  
{125}{}{Congrats on the promotion, Ranger.}  
{126}{}{You've got the badge, but respect? That you'll have to earn.}  
{127}{}{I've got my eye on you... Ranger.}  
{128}{}{Keep things in line out there in the Wastes.}  
{129}{}{Hope that badge comes with a sense of responsibility.}  

#Robe
{130}{}{Get lost, you damn cultist!}  
{131}{}{Wearing those robes? Might as well paint a target on your back.}  
{132}{}{I've seen some bad armor, but that takes the cake.}  
{133}{}{Who let you run off with the road signs?}  
{134}{}{That blue jumpsuit makes you stick out like a sore thumb.}  
{135}{}{That's a... bold outfit choice.}  
{136}{}{Who gave you that armor? Start talking!}  
{137}{}{Hello, rang... Wait a minute, you're not one of ours!}  
{138}{}{What's with that tin can you're wearing? Ditch it, now! Or... give it to me...}  
{139}{}{Cadets get proper leather armor made from brahmin hide, not... whatever that is.}  

#Reputation
{140}{}{Buzz off.}
{141}{}{I ain't gonna gab with you.}
{142}{}{Anything to say?}
{143}{}{You shouldn't stick around here too long.}
{144}{}{Our bullets carry mercy.}
{145}{}{Hello.}
{146}{}{Don't do anything stupid if you want to maintain a good rep.}
{147}{}{Good to see you.}
{148}{}{How are you?}
{149}{}{Good luck out there.}
