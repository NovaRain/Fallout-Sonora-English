{100}{}{You see Diana.}
{101}{}{You see a bald woman with a rather thoughtful look.}
{102}{}{Oh, of course, please.}
{103}{}{Good to see you.}

{110}{}{Hey, are we here already?}
{111}{}{Big city. Almost like the Hub. Brings back memories...}
{112}{}{This city feels like a prison. I wonder if the locals are happy.}
{113}{}{A city of nomad cattlemen. What a surprise.}
{114}{}{This place gives me the creeps.}
{115}{}{I don't like this place. Be careful.}
{116}{}{Is this your hometown? Your hard work is admirable.}
{117}{}{I can't believe it. These are the legendary Desert Rangers!}
{118}{}{Don't you think we've wandered too far south?}
{119}{}{Finally, we're out of that hellhole.}
{120}{}{Hmm. Seems the locals don't like outsiders much.}

#First Dialogue
{200}{}{Thank God, there's someone here with a human face!}
{201}{}{Who are you?}
{202}{}{Diana. I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, headed to Casa Nueva. But my convoy was attacked by crazed ghouls... Reavers I guess. I got captured and brought here. Don't even know if anyone else from my group survived.}
{203}{}{I'm really sorry to hear that, Diana.}
{204}{}{Got it.}
{205}{}{And what about you? Did the Reavers capture you too?}
{206}{}{Actually, I'm here by chance. Slavers took the people from my village, and I'm looking for them.}
{207}{}{Hmm. I've heard the slave trade is growing in the east. But I don't think you'll find anyone here except mutants.}
{208}{}{So you're planning to escape from here?}
{209}{}{That's not important. Are you planning to escape from here?}
{210}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel sent me for backup.}
{211}{}{Yeah, the Brotherhood never abandons their own. Can't fault them for that.}
{212}{}{So you're planning to escape from here?}
{213}{}{I'm afraid getting out won't be easy. If we try to leave the cathedral, the guards will catch us. But even if we get outside, the Reavers will tear us apart.}
{214}{}{We'll need to be smarter about this.}
{215}{}{Exactly. I don't want bloodshed. And Levi seems to agree. He promised to let us go if I help him with his research.}
{216}{}{Is there any way to fight them off?}
{217}{}{I'm not a fan of bloodshed. Levi promised to let us go if I help him with his research. But if you're really itching for a fight, Power Armor is a must.}
{218}{}{I need to assess the situation and think it over.}
{219}{}{}
{220}{}{Sure. But don't leave me behind. The children of Casa Nueva are waiting for my biology lessons.}
{221}{}{Alright...}

#Repeat Dialogue
{250}{}{So, what's your plan?}
{251}{}{Wait for my signal.}
{252}{}{What does Levi say?}

{260}{}{Tell me what's going on here.}
{261}{}{Okay. What exactly do you want to know?}
{262}{}{I think that's all for now.}

#About Her Mission
{270}{}{I'm interested in your mission.}
{271}{}{I was heading to Casa Nueva. That settlement needs scientists and teachers. A few Followers are already conducting research there.}
{272}{}{I think that's all for now.}
{273}{}{Can you show me where it is?}
{274}{}{Sure. Open your map, I'll show you...}
{275}{}{Thanks.}
{276}{}{I've been to that town. Nice place.}
{277}{}{Really? That's great. Makes me want to get there even more.}
{278}{}{We'll get back to this... if we get out of here.}
{279}{}{Casa Nueva was built by slaves, and peons work the plantations there. The scientists are leeching off their labor.}
{280}{}{Yeah, it's hard to balance science and manual labor. And it's definitely wrong to oppress anyone. But we're trying to make the world better. Besides, it wasn't us using slaves, but the Brotherhood's mercenaries.}
{281}{}{Alright, that sounds convincing.}
{282}{}{Yeah, like that changes anything.}

{290}{}{Who are these Followers of the Apocalypse?}
{291}{}{We're kind of a charity. We teach people to read and write, treat diseases, and enlighten them with pre-war knowledge.}
{292}{}{So you're looking to revive the Old World?}
{293}{}{Not quite. History may repeat, but not identically. The Old World can't be brought back as it was, nor should it be.}
{294}{}{Phew, I thought you were delusional.}
{295}{}{Got it.}
{296}{}{You're nuts! The Old World fell because of that knowledge.}
{297}{}{It's not the knowledge itself, but how it's used. We aim to prevent repeating the Old World's mistakes.}
{298}{}{Good luck keeping track of everyone.}
{299}{}{Your goals are noble. Hope others see it that way too.}
{300}{}{How did you get ambushed?}
{301}{}{Reavers attacked us, set an ambush, created a dust cloud, and dragged me out of the group. Levi's men, who were nearby, saved me and brought me here.}
{302}{}{And you still thank him for that?}
{303}{}{I don't think they're bad at heart. Levi just follows the path he believes is right. Plus, he's forced into it.}
{304}{}{What about your compatriots?}
{305}{}{So the Reavers were working for Levi?}
{306}{}{Probably. Levi's like a god -- or a devil -- to them. They try to please him and follow his orders. But that's just my guess.}
{307}{}{What happened to your compatriots?}
{308}{}{Our squad had several Brotherhood of Steel members. Paladin Barkley led us. After I was taken, I heard nothing. I don't know if they're alive or dead.}
{309}{}{I see.}

{310}{}{You mentioned the Brotherhood of Steel. Tell me more about them.}
{311}{}{They're a closed military organization in California. Our relationship is strained, so they reluctantly included me in the convoy.}
{312}{}{What do they do?}
{313}{}{Mostly, they're dormant. But lately, they've been buying up all the nuclear batteries around. They're top-notch in energy weapons and pre-war tech but hoard it all for themselves.}
{314}{}{Got it. Enough about the Brotherhood.}
{315}{}{What are they doing in Arizona?}
{316}{}{Likely gathering technology and energy sources. Arizona has many intact pre-war sites.}
{317}{}{Do you know where their base is?}
{318}{}{Their only outpost is on an old warship in Puerto Penasco, by the Gulf of California.}
{319}{}{What are they doing in Arizona?}
{320}{}{Thanks. That's what I needed to know.}

#- about this city
{330}{}{What do you know about this city?}
{331}{}{Before the War, it was called Mexicali. A large border city. The Reds decimated it when they bombed numerous local factories.}
{332}{}{Alright, never mind.}
{333}{}{Tell me about these Reavers. What are they?}
{334}{}{They're like ghouls, demonic remnants of Mexicali's residents who survived the nuclear bombing of 2077. Like wild ghouls, they were once human. I feel deeply sorry for them. They're sometimes called demons by folks 'round here, and for them, the ruins *are* an eternal hell.}
{335}{}{I see. Let's change the subject.}
{336}{}{Why do they build totems out of bones?}
{337}{}{The Reavers form something akin to beast packs. Each group claims its territory, and the totems serve as their markers.}
{338}{}{Got it. Enough about the Reavers.}
{339}{}{Do they have any weaknesses? I need to know where to hit if I encounter them again.}
{340}{}{They're fast, tough, and often move in packs. Best to keep your distance. Against a crowd, weapons of mass destruction are most effective. But remember, they were once human too.}
{341}{}{Noted, for ambush planning.}
{342}{}{You're defending these demons? You're foolish, Diana.}
{343}{}{Why the bone totems?}
{344}{}{They're almost a hundred years old?! How can that be?}
{345}{}{Are you saying they're nearly a century old?}
{346}{}{It's a long story. Want to hear it all?}
{347}{}{No. Just curious who they are.}
{348}{}{Yes, it may just be a tale, but I want to know.}
{349}{}{There was a lab nearby experimenting with a dangerous virus. A nuclear blast damaged the complex, releasing the virus and spreading it worldwide.}
{350}{}{Go on.}
{351}{}{This city was quickly shrouded in a poisonous cloud. The virus, mixed with radiation, had a bizarre effect, granting the inhabitants immortality. Though I doubt they're happy about it. Not just these 'demons', but all wildlife here mutated.}
{352}{}{What kind of virus was it?}
{353}{}{Forced Evolution Virus. A secret military project. In our time, the Master used FEV to create an army of super mutants. Levi's followers are the result of these inhumane experiments.}
{354}{}{Judging by his followers, the virus had many side effects.}
{355}{}{The Master conducted many experiments with varied outcomes. Many died before he found a balance. Even his best mutants need periodic doses of stabilizing substances. Plus, each mutant has unique characteristics. It's all very complex.}
{356}{}{Got it. Thanks for the story.}

{360}{}{Tell me about the Power Armor.}
{361}{}{It was being transported to a military base in Puerto Penasco. When the Reavers attacked the convoy, no one had a chance to use this pre-war marvel.}
{362}{}{Is it still operational?}
{363}{}{Mostly. It got a bit banged up during transport, but the main systems are intact. The issue is that some parts are missing.}
{364}{}{What's missing from the armor?}
{365}{}{The nuclear reactor was dismantled for study. Apparently, Levi is exploring alternative uses for this energy source.}
{366}{}{Anything else?}
{367}{}{Levi keeps the main processor with him so no one can activate the armor without his permission.}
{368}{}{Does it come with a helmet?}
{369}{}{The helmet was lost during transport, likely left where the ghouls attacked us.}
{370}{}{Now I know what to look for.}
{371}{}{Alright, I'll think about it.}
{372}{}{I found this helmet near the monument. Will it fit?}
{1372}{}{I found this helmet near the monument. Will it fit?}
{373}{}{Yes, that's it. Just connect it to the armor.}
{374}{}{Alright.}

{380}{}{What do you know about Levi and his cult?}
{381}{}{Not much, but enough to respect and hate him simultaneously.}
{382}{}{Enough about the cult.}
{383}{}{Who is he?}
{384}{}{Levi was one of the Master's followers, like Morpheus and the others close to him. He stayed loyal to his leader until the end, until the cult was destroyed in 2161.}
{385}{}{Is he a mutant too?}
{386}{}{Levi took the mutagen as part of his initiation. Now he suffers from its side effects, so he wears a mask to mitigate the toxic air. His followers don't need it, though.}
{387}{}{What brought him to these ruins?}
{388}{}{Nowadays, Californians have driven out people like him. These ruins likely seemed like a safe haven to Levi, a refuge from the world. No normal person would venture into such radioactive muck. Except us, apparently.}
{389}{}{What does Levi want from you?}
{390}{}{He needs my scientific skills for his "Complementation Project." That's what he calls it.}
{391}{}{A project for what?}
{392}{}{Complementation Project - what's that about?}
{393}{}{It's hard to explain, and I wasn't told everything. Levi's people are the result of an old experiment. Want to know more?}
{394}{}{No time for history lessons. We need to escape this hell.}
{395}{}{No, let's skip the story. What exactly does Levi need?}
{396}{}{Yes, tell me about the experiments.}
{397}{}{Years ago, the Master's cult flourished in the west. He used a pre-war virus to create his army of super mutants. After the Master's death, his army scattered.}
{398}{}{Are Levi's people the remnants of this cult?}
{399}{}{Yes. But the Master's experiments had a wide range of results, both successful and fatal. All mutants have defects in one way or another.}
{400}{}{And Levi is trying to cure them?}
{401}{}{Yes. First, we need to stabilize the virus in their blood. Some suffer from a lack of the virus, others from an excess, each with unique symptoms.}
{402}{}{Go on.}
{403}{}{Levi is also trying to tame the wild ghouls, the reavers, making them his servants, though their nature differs greatly from his ghouls.}
{404}{}{What will happen in the end?}
{405}{}{A small mutant empire, a radioactive paradise for the elite. No mere mortal will be allowed entry.}
{406}{}{Interesting. But let's focus. What does Levi need from you?}
{407}{}{Levi demands a virus stabilizer for his flock. Some of his people suffer without enough mutagen, while others need to suppress the virus to avoid turning completely feral.}
{408}{}{Sounds too complex given the chaos we're in.}
{409}{}{Forget it.}
{410}{}{Exactly. Luckily, Levi brought a small lab with him. The main issue is a shortage of synthesized substances, especially benzene and pesticides. With more raw materials, I could solve the mutagen problem.}
{411}{}{You're crazy! Why not just poison this hellish church?}
{412}{}{I understand your anger. But these people deserve a chance. They've endured a lot. Maybe my help will change them for the better.}
{413}{}{Fine. But I'm still for poison if it comes to it.}
{414}{}{Perhaps. I hope you're not making a mistake.}
{415}{}{If making the mutagen gets us out of here, it's worth a try. Things can't get much worse.}
{416}{}{Exactly. My heart aches imagining their suffering.}
{417}{}{It'd be easier to shoot them all. What's needed for the mutagen?}
{418}{}{Okay. But where can you find these substances?}
{419}{}{I had a chemical bag with everything needed. Levi's men couldn't find it. One of the Reavers likely took it to the ruins.}
{420}{}{Great, another scavenger hunt.}
{421}{}{Please find the bag. The ambush was near the monument on Interstate 5, west of here.}
{422}{}{Okay, I'll be back.}
{423}{}{Alright. But don't make me regret this.}
{424}{}{Remind me what I need to find?}

### Chemistry Kit

{430}{}{Here's your chemistry kit.}  
{431}{}{Thank God! I was worried the ghouls had torn it apart. Let's see... Yes, this has what I need. First, we need to run some tests. Place the kit on that lab table over there...}
{432}{}{[More]}  
{433}{}{...So... hmm... give me that test tube over there... Look, it's turning green. Now, we just need to conduct clinical trials. Fortunately, we have prototypes.}  
{434}{}{You want to use those reavers? Looks like we have no other choice.}  
{435}{}{You're a real badass, Diana. I'm starting to like you.}  
{436}{}{Hmm... how interesting. Notice how the test subjects have become calmer. Now, I'll examine their blood cells under a microscope... So... Hey, we did it! I think this is exactly what Levi wanted.}  
{437}{}{Good news. I'll talk to Levi.}  
{438}{}{I already have your things.}  
{439}{}{No need to kill anyone. I can't test the mutagen on the dead. }  

### Leaving the Area

{450}{}{Get ready. We're leaving.}  
{451}{}{Are you sure this is the right move? I don't want to get caught in the crossfire again.}  
{1451}{}{Are you sure this is the right move? I don't want to get caught in the crossfire again.}  
{452}{}{You're right. We need to scout the situation first. I'll be back soon.}  
{453}{}{Levi is dead. I doubt the other mutants will be as happy with us.}  
{454}{}{Levi is dead? How sad... Well, the temple is really unsafe now. I doubt I'll be of any use here.}  
{455}{}{That's it. We need to get out of here as soon as possible.}  
{456}{}{Actually, I'm not sure that's accurate. Wait while I check.}  
{457}{}{This is dangerous. But every hour it gets worse. We must hurry if we want to survive. Let's go.}  
{458}{}{I really hope you know what you're doing.}  
{459}{}{Trust me. I'll lead you out of this hell.}  
{460}{}{Hmm. Your words make me think. Wait a little. I'm going to scout around.}  
{461}{}{Levi gave us freedom. We can leave.}  
{462}{}{Thank God! I believed Levi was a good man and would keep his word.}  
{463}{}{Then pack your things. It's time.}  
{464}{}{We'll have to wait a little longer. I need to get ready for the trip.}  

### The Consignment

{500}{}{Where are we heading, captain?}  
{501}{}{Just follow me.}  
{502}{}{Where do you want to go?}  
{503}{}{To the city of Casa Nueva.}  
{504}{}{Why?}  
{505}{}{My brothers and sisters have an outpost there. I have to help them at the local school.}  
{506}{}{Can you show this place on the map?}  
{507}{}{Of course. Open your map... Oh, you have a Pip-Boy. What a surprise. Relic, you say? Okay... yes. It's here in the Sonoran Desert, in the southeast.}  
{508}{}{I see. Let's go then.}  
{509}{}{But why do you need to go there?}  

### Parting Ways

{510}{}{Diana, we must part ways.}  
{511}{}{So soon? Eh, I've never been lucky in long-term relationships.}  
{512}{}{It can't be helped. Return my things and go wherever you want.}  
{513}{}{You're right. We better stick together.}  
{514}{}{Stop dawdling. It's time for us to go.}  
{515}{}{As you say, captain.}  
{516}{}{Let's go.}  
{517}{}{I need to leave you for a while. Stay here for now.}  
{518}{}{You're not going to leave me, are you, my love? Okay, have it your way.}  
{519}{}{Just wait here.}  
{520}{}{Sorry, I now realize that I need you. Will you come with me?}  
{521}{}{About weapons. It's better to hide them.}  
{522}{}{Oh, now you're worried about someone getting hurt. How nice of you.}  
{523}{}{Can we avoid sarcasm?}  
{524}{}{No, stupid, I want to protect myself.}  
{525}{}{Take off this armor.}  
{526}{}{You're not going to strip me naked, are you? Although, sometimes I'd like to feel that free.}  
{527}{}{Um, that's not exactly what I mean.}  
{528}{}{Have you come back for me? This is so romantic.}  
{1528}{}{You came back for me? This is so romantic.}  

### Medical Help

{530}{}{I was hit. Do something!}  
{531}{}{Sorry, but you'll have to be patient. Your wounds are not serious enough to waste our last medicine.}  
{532}{}{So this is how the Followers treat patients? I'll keep this in mind for the future.}  
{533}{}{Yes, you're right. It's worth saving medications for emergencies.}  
{534}{}{Your wounds are not fatal, but your injuries will greatly hinder your journey. We'll have to consider surgery. True, I have little practice...}  
{535}{}{Do something already!}  
{536}{}{I trust you, Doc.}  
{537}{}{Oh my god, you're covered in blood! This is no good. Lie down, I'll have to use the last of our medicine on you...}  
{1537}{}{Oh my god, you're covered in blood! This is no good. Lie down, I'll have to use the last of our medicine on you...}  
{538}{}{Don't let me sleep, Doc...}  
{539}{}{We'll have to be patient. You didn't care about others' wounds, did you? Feel what it's like. Maybe this will teach you kindness.}  
{540}{}{That's it, then? Leaving me because of my bad reputation? Okay, I'll remember that, bitch.}  
{541}{}{Okay. But if I die, it will be on your conscience.}  
{542}{}{Look, I don't want to offend anyone, but your loud company will slow us down. And I need to get to Casa Nueva as quickly as possible.}  
{543}{}{Then you can do without my help. Bye.}  
{544}{}{I'll talk to them. Wait a bit.}  

### Conversations

{550}{}{Let's talk.}  
{551}{}{What do you want to know?}  
{552}{}{Never mind, forget it.}  

### Pip-Boy

{560}{}{Why are you so excited about my Pip-Boy?}  
{561}{}{Well, it's old technology. Computer like that were distributed to residents of special bomb shelters. Vaults. I didn't expect to find this thing far from major cities.}  
{562}{}{Yes, this is a device from Vault 27. Only ghosts live there now.}  
{563}{}{Ha ha, good joke.} 
{564}{}{Let's continue on our way.}  
{565}{}{Wait. You mean his home vault is somewhere in Arizona?}  
{566}{}{Show me the markings on the back... Okay. Yes, it's from Vault 27. I don't know for sure, but I think it's probably located somewhere near Phoenix.}  
{567}{}{Thanks, Diana. This is valuable information.}

### Weapons

{570}{}{What weapon are you best with?}  
{571}{}{I'd rather avoid fights altogether, if that's an option.}  
{572}{}{Do you even know why a gun needs a trigger?}  
{573}{}{Oh my god... Well, I'm good with laser and plasma weapons, but terrible with firearms and hand-to-hand combat. Is that okay with you?}  
{574}{}{That's enough.}  
{575}{}{Traveling with you is like having a cactus for a companion. All clear now.}  

### Opinions on the Place

{580}{}{What do you think of this place?}  
{581}{}{I see.}  
{582}{}{Nothing special. Just the usual landscape for this season.}  
{583}{}{This must be the city we're supposed to reach. Let's ask the locals about the Followers.}  
{584}{}{Big city. Almost like the Hub. Let's go shopping?}  
{585}{}{Big city, but this area looks inhospitable. Stay on your guard and don't let the locals fool you.}  
{586}{}{Big church? It reminds me of something. Listen, I don't feel comfortable here. Let's leave quickly.}  
{587}{}{Wow, they've done well in this vault. The equipment is in excellent condition. Amazing. Oh, if only my brothers and sisters could see this, how many people we could help!}  
{588}{}{Are you kidding me? Just let me wipe the rat droppings off my cloak and I'll try to answer you...}  
{589}{}{The town looks depressing. Places like this often hide terrible secrets.}  
{590}{}{Incredible! These people have even learned microchipping. I really need to talk to their scientists... though I doubt they'll speak with me.}  
{591}{}{We need to get out of here as soon as possible.}  
{592}{}{Brotherhood of Steel outpost. This is where my convoy was headed. Shall we go to the quartermaster to replenish supplies?}  
{593}{}{Before the War, this was the large border city of Mexicali. The Reds destroyed it when they bombed the local factories. There were a lot of them here.}  
{594}{}{Finally, we found something alive in this desert! But it looks like we're not welcome here.}  
{595}{}{I don't feel good about this place.}  
{596}{}{Don't you think we've strayed too far from our intended goal? Remember, I need to get to Casa Nueva.}  
{597}{}{What's your mission?}  

### Coming to Casa Nueva

{600}{}{We're here. Is it time to say goodbye?}  
{601}{}{Yes. Now this is my new home. An amazing place - so much greenery surrounded by endless desert. Imagine what it took to make all this. I'm eager to find out how they did it.}  
{602}{}{A new chapter of your life begins.}  
{603}{}{Thank you. You've saved not only me, but also the people who live here. Together, we'll try to make Casa Nueva an oasis where people can live in peace and harmony.}  
{604}{}{Yes, please. I knew right away this was the right thing to do.}  
{605}{}{I'll tell my brothers about you. Thanks again.}  
{606}{}{Goodbye, Diana.}  
{607}{}{So, are you going to let me go with nothing?}  
{608}{}{Sorry, I don't have much to offer. I'll try to get you some locally produced medicines and food for the road. Thanks again.}  
{609}{}{Well, at least it's something. Goodbye, Diana.}  

### Greetings and Farewells

{610}{}{Good to see you.}  
{611}{}{Hello. Hm, is it just me, or do the locals really avoid you?}  
{612}{}{I didn't know. Turns out you're considered a hero here.}  
{1612}{}{I didn't know. Turns out you're considered a hero here.}  
{613}{}{Just saying hello. We need to run now.}  
{614}{}{Good God, what's going on here? The locals seem to have gone crazy. Looks like I'll have a lot of work to do here.}
