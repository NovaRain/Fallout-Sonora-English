{100}{}{You see a ranger.}
{101}{}{You see a ranger in desert gear. He gestures in greeting.}
{102}{}{Yes, I could use that.}

# First Dialogue
{200}{}{Hey, traveler, hold up! Not often you see folks around these parts. Mind telling me what you're doing here?}
{1200}{}{Hey, traveler, hold up! Not often you see folks around these parts. Mind telling me what you're doing here?}
{201}{}{I'm on a mission for Commander Helford.}
{202}{}{That figures. The commander's been saying he's short on people. Well, be careful, this place isn't safe.}
{203}{}{The ranger cartographer asked me to take some measurements.}
{204}{}{About time someone did that. But now it's too dangerous for mapping.}
{205}{}{I'm just scavenging for pre-war tech.}
{206}{}{A scavenger, huh? You've come a long way for loot. But trust me, this isn't the best place to search. Anything valuable is long gone, and it's not safe to be here.}
{207}{}{That's none of your business.}
{208}{}{Alright. But keep in mind these ruins are too dangerous. If you get into trouble, don't expect help from me or any other rangers.}
{209}{}{Why is it so dangerous?}
{210}{}{Radiation levels have risen recently. The locals have gone mad and now attack anyone they see. Be cautious. I've warned you, the rest is up to you.}
{211}{}{Thanks for the warning.}
{212}{}{You're just trying to scare me. Better step aside.}
{213}{}{I'll manage. Goodbye.}

# Repeat Dialogue
{220}{}{Yes?}
{221}{}{Goodbye.}
{222}{}{Let's go back a bit.}
{223}{}{Looks like that was the last of them. May they rest in peace.}

{230}{}{Are there any residents left here?}
{231}{}{I'm here on Commander Helford's request. Where is the refugee camp?}
{232}{}{The locals can no longer be called human. They've gone mad, don't understand speech, and attack anyone they see. They still mostly haunt the trailer park across from the gas station. Go down the street and then turn left.}
{233}{}{Who are they?}
{234}{}{Just ordinary refugees from the east. Came here hoping for a new life, but found only suffering. If you see them, it's better to put them out of their misery.}
{235}{}{Why have they gone mad?}
{236}{}{I don't know, but I think it's due to radiation.}
{237}{}{The locals can no longer be called human. They've gone mad, don't understand speech, and attack anyone they see. They still mostly roam around the trailer park.}

{240}{}{Why is it radioactive here?}
{241}{}{I'd like to know that too. After the Great War, there was high radiation here due to winds from California. But over time, the radiation levels normalized. The locals must have found something they shouldn't have.}

{250}{}{Who are you?}
{251}{}{I'm a ranger. My task is to set up radiation warnings and, if possible, eliminate all the crazed locals. After that, I'll return to my duty in the east.}
{252}{}{Are you here alone?}
{253}{}{Yeah. Many rangers have been sent east, leaving only a few patrols here. Anyway, this area's always been sparsely populated.}
{254}{}{I need an escort. Will you come with me?}
{255}{}{That's too dangerous. Two of us attract their attention, and I'm better out in the wasteland than in the city.}
{256}{}{Without your protection, I won't make it out alive.}
{257}{}{I'm a ranger too. Together, we can deal with these locals more easily.}
{258}{}{I don't protect people like you.}
{259}{}{People like me? You don't know anything about me.}
{260}{}{Just leave these ruins if you can't handle yourself.}
{261}{}{Not until I get all the answers I need from you.}
{262}{}{That's exactly what I'll do. Goodbye.}
{263}{}{(skeptically) Okay. But don't forget about the radiation.}
{264}{}{Let's go!}
{265}{}{Let's move.}
