{100}{}{You see a player in front of you.}

{101}{}{Looks like this player is riding a wave of luck.}
{102}{}{You see a casino client in a frenzy from a winning streak.}
{103}{}{This player looks bored. He's not winning, but he's not losing either.}
{104}{}{You see a casino client fuming over a string of losses.}
{105}{}{Panic fills this player's eyes. He's clearly lost his entire fortune.}

{109}{}{How did you get in here wearing that armor?}

# Response
# - Fine
{110}{}{Isn't this place a blast?}
{111}{}{I'm on a roll, how about you?}
{112}{}{Got a feeling today's my lucky day.}
{113}{}{This has got to be the best casino in the wasteland.}
{114}{}{I know the tricks to win, trust me.}
{115}{}{You into this game? It's a real rush.}
{116}{}{Caps, baby! Caps!}
{117}{}{Don't go messing with my luck.}
{118}{}{Why does this keep happening to me?}
{119}{}{I think I just cracked the code.}
{120}{}{Step aside.}
{121}{}{Don't block the view.}
{122}{}{Today's the day I clean this place out!}
{123}{}{I already feel like a part of the machine here.}
{124}{}{We've been around here long enough, huh?}
{125}{}{Don't bet everything on the booze.}
{126}{}{Think you've got the guts to play me?}
{127}{}{Damn broke tourists...}
{128}{}{Quit distracting me while I'm playing.}
{129}{}{Wanna share some luck? Nah, hit the road.}

# - bad
{150}{}{This place sucks. I can't win a damn thing.}
{151}{}{I'm doing worse than ever. How about you?}
{152}{}{Luck's just not on my side today.}
{153}{}{This isn't a casino, it's a rip-off joint.}
{154}{}{I swear, I'll never win here.}
{155}{}{Why am I even playing this? It's pointless.}
{156}{}{Hey, spot me some caps, will you?}
{157}{}{If I win, drinks are on me.}
{158}{}{Hope your luck's better than mine.}
{159}{}{This losing streak is never gonna end.}
{160}{}{I really need a win... badly.}
{161}{}{Eh, it's just a game, right?}
{162}{}{These dice are rigged, I swear.}
{163}{}{They've gotta be cheating. No way this is legit.}
{164}{}{Lady Luck's totally turned on me.}
{165}{}{Scammers are crawling all over this place.}
{166}{}{I'm already out of chips... again.}
{167}{}{Luck's a cruel mistress.}
{168}{}{I managed to win a whole 60 chips! Then... poof.}
{169}{}{Feels like my whole life's on the line here.}
{170}{}{Watch your back, this place reeks of scams.}
{171}{}{They've definitely rigged these machines. No doubt about it.}

# Random remarks
# - Badly
{200}{}{Come on, damn it!}
{201}{}{Why is this game so damn cruel to me?}
{202}{}{I'm cursed with bad luck today.}
{203}{}{What a garbage game!}
{204}{}{I hate this stupid game.}
{205}{}{I'm burning up over here!}
{206}{}{It was going so well... what happened?}
{207}{}{I either win or I'm done for.}
{208}{}{One more loss and I'll flip this place upside down.}
{209}{}{I'm not leaving until I win something.}
{210}{}{I just can't catch a break.}
{211}{}{I'm almost flat broke!}
{212}{}{A little longer and I'll be completely bankrupt.}
{213}{}{I'm so sick of losing.}
{214}{}{Are we seriously down to the last few chips?}
{215}{}{Damn it all!}
{216}{}{If my luck doesn't turn soon, I'm out of here.}
{217}{}{My pockets are empty...}
{218}{}{Just a little further...}
{219}{}{Not this again!}
{220}{}{I'm sinking fast.}
{221}{}{Eh, should I give it one more try?}
{222}{}{No, no, no, stop!}
{223}{}{Oops. That's bad.}
{224}{}{So close!}
{225}{}{Damn it!}
{226}{}{How did it go so wrong?}
{227}{}{Why always me?}
{228}{}{Again?! Seriously?!}
{229}{}{No luck whatsoever...}
{230}{}{I need a stiff drink.}
{231}{}{Everything was against me today.}
{232}{}{Almost had it!}
{233}{}{Just wait, I'll break the bank soon.}
{234}{}{Great, another beggar coming around...}
{235}{}{Ugh, I need a bathroom break.}
{236}{}{Maybe I should sell my spleen to get back in the game...}
{237}{}{Not in this lifetime.}
{238}{}{Stop mocking me, universe!}
{239}{}{Today's just not my day.}
{240}{}{Screw you!}
{241}{}{Oh no, not again!}

# - Fine
{300}{}{Yes! Jackpot!}
{301}{}{Come on, don't fail me now.}
{302}{}{Feeling lucky today, for sure.}
{303}{}{This game's on fire!}
{304}{}{I absolutely love this!}
{305}{}{Is this real, or am I dreaming?}
{306}{}{Awesome, let's keep it rolling.}
{307}{}{Today's my day to live large.}
{308}{}{If I keep winning, drinks are on me!}
{309}{}{You don't stop when you're on a streak!}
{310}{}{There's no way I'm losing now.}
{311}{}{I can smell those caps coming.}
{312}{}{At this rate, I'll be the richest in town!}
{313}{}{It just keeps getting better.}
{314}{}{Caps, caps, and more caps!}
{315}{}{Hell yeah!}
{316}{}{Luck's definitely on my side now.}
{317}{}{Looks like those chips belong to me now.}
{318}{}{If only it could always be this good...}
{319}{}{Woohoo! Another win!}
{320}{}{Keep it coming, baby!}
{321}{}{Of course I'm winning!}
{322}{}{Come on, let's do this!}
{323}{}{This is great!}
{324}{}{Alright, let's go!}
{325}{}{Waiter, another drink over here!}
{326}{}{Don't let me down, Lady Luck.}
{327}{}{Who's the winner? That's right, it's me!}
{328}{}{Ha ha! I'm unstoppable!}
{329}{}{Guess I'll be sleeping like a king tonight.}

# - In front of the stage
{350}{}{Veronica's got a great voice.}
{351}{}{She's stunning, isn't she?}
{352}{}{She could use a bit more energy, though.}
{353}{}{She looks like she's been through hell before the show.}
{354}{}{Her songs are pretty sad, huh?}
{355}{}{What's she even singing about?}
{356}{}{Maybe it's time to switch up the setlist.}
{357}{}{I'll just sit back and listen.}
{358}{}{This is the only spot with live music.}
{359}{}{Nowhere else around has a singer.}
{360}{}{I love this casino just for the live performances.}
{361}{}{You can't find live shows anywhere else in town.}
{362}{}{Bartender, another cocktail over here!}
{363}{}{What's my tab at, bartender?}
{364}{}{Bartender, I need to settle up.}
{365}{}{Looks like I'm coming up short...}
{366}{}{This is the best bar in the city, hands down.}
{367}{}{The brahmin steaks here are top-notch.}
{368}{}{Hate to leave after a show like this.}
{369}{}{}
