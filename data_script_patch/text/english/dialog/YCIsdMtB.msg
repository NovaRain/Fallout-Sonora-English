{102}{}{Today we're feeling kind. But don't cross our path again.}
{103}{}{Death to normies!}
{104}{}{Save me from these stupid mutants!}
{105}{}{The last time I got roughed up like this was before the war. The mafia back then, mutants now - not much has changed.}
{106}{}{Phew, I thought I was done for. Here, take a stimpak and my thanks as a reward. Thank you, friend.}
{107}{}{}
{108}{}{}
{109}{}{}

{200}{}{Well, well... what we got here? Come here, human! You're gonna be my snack.}
{201}{}{Big mistake, idiot.}
{202}{}{Take it easy... back off!}
{203}{}{My brothers got the same treatment when normies attacked! DIE BITCH!}
{204}{}{Stop you mutant freak!}
{205}{}{No, please...}
{206}{}{Listen, I'm trying to help ghouls, and uh, mutants. I'm not your enemy!}
{207}{}{You? Helpin' ghouls? Ha! That's a good one! Didn't know they made 'em this dumb.}
{1207}{}{You? Helpin' ghouls? Ha! That's a good one! Didn't know they made 'em this dumb.}
{208}{}{Come on, just let me and this ghoul go. No one's threatening you.}
{209}{}{Why am I even talking to you? Die, freaks!}
{210}{}{You ain't even worth smashin'. But don't let me catch you again.}
{211}{}{Alrighty then...}
{212}{}{Another ghoul! We're makin' a good haul today!}
{213}{}{You look big and menacing, but you're brainless.}
{214}{}{Please, don't hurt us! We're of the same blood!}
{215}{}{We're not enemies. We're both mutants. Can't we be friends?}
{216}{}{What'd you say? Shut up, scavenger! We're soldiers of the Master, not filth like you!}
{217}{}{Seems like I just made him angrier...}
{1217}{}{Seems like I just made him angrier...}
{218}{}{Hmph. Maybe you're right. They all hate us anyway. But we're real soldiers! You're just a scrappy half-breed!}
{219}{}{Sure. I'll remember that.}
{220}{}{Gomer? I never thought you'd side with humans.}
{221}{}{Yes, he and I decided to join forces. Is that so bad?}
{222}{}{Normies and Nightkin... teamin' up? Huh. If Gomer's with ya, fine. Just stay outta our way.}
{223}{}{That's good then.}
