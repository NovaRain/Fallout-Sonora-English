{100}{}{You see a drug dealer.}
{101}{}{You see a drug dealer, or something like that.}
{102}{}{The dealer has raised his prices.}
{103}{}{You got a discount on the dealer's goods.}
{104}{}{Careful with that, kid. You're cruising for some serious trouble.}

#First Encounter
{200}{}{Hey, pal, you're looking sharp. How about a little fun in this town before Lady Luck leaves you high and dry?}  
{1200}{}{Hey, babe, you're looking sharp. How about a little fun in this town before Lady Luck leaves you high and dry?}  
{201}{}{What exactly are you offering?}  
{202}{}{All kinds of pleasures. Pop this pill, and you'll get a high no casino can match. Trust me, I've tried it myself.}  
{203}{}{So, you're selling drugs, huh?}  
{204}{}{I doubt you've got anything worth my time.}  
{205}{}{Sure, sure, whatever you say, pal. But trust me, you're turning down the last bit of joy left in this rotten world.}  
{206}{}{Pleasure, huh? Now you're speaking my language.}  
{207}{}{What exactly are you pushing?}  
{208}{}{I don't know what you mean. I've got clean stimpaks, antidotes - nothing illegal here. The real question is how you use them. But hey, that's (winks) your business, not mine.}  
{209}{}{I get the picture.}  

#Follow-Up Dialogue
{210}{}{Yo, need a fix?}
{211}{}{Lookin' for a little somethin' to take the edge off?}
{212}{}{After a taste of the good stuff?}
{213}{}{Need to score a hit?}
{214}{}{Got a craving? I've got what you need right here.}
{215}{}{What kind of buzz you chasing today?}

{216}{}{Stay low. We'll cross paths again.}
{217}{}{Yeah, play it safe.}
{218}{}{Keep your head down. See you around.}
{219}{}{This never happened. Got it? Later.}

#Rude Reply and Fight
{220}{}{Listen up, estupida. I've got people who *run* this area. And who are you to lay down the law here? Think they'll let that slide? Don't make a scene, or there'll be trouble.}
{221}{}{Scene? Is your bloody corpse lying in the street a scene?}
{222}{}{Sorry, that was stupid. Take it easy, pal.}
{223}{}{Hey, man, you're getting on my nerves. Calm down, or I'll call my boys.}
{1223}{}{Lady, you're getting on my nerves. Calm down, or I'll introduce you to my hand.}
{224}{}{Come on, sucker! Bring it!}
{225}{}{Sorry, no need to call anyone. I'm calming down.}
{226}{}{You're crazy! Die, pendejo!}
{1226}{}{You're crazy! Die, pendeja!}
{227}{}{Die yourself, scum!}
{228}{}{Time to put you down.}

#Inquiries
{230}{}{So what kind of drugs are you selling?}
{231}{}{What do you need? Name it, I can get you a stimpak, RadAway, or... (winks) something stronger. Catch my drift?}
{232}{}{I'll keep it in mind. See you around.}
{233}{}{But where do you get all this stuff?}
{234}{}{Stronger? Like Buffout and Psycho?}
{235}{}{Sorry, but the fire worshippers banned me from selling that kind of stuff. They buy up all the military drugs themselves.}
{236}{}{Why would they want old army drugs?}
{237}{}{They claim it's for the city's good... Look, I really don't know why, but I'm not looking to break the rules. However... (leans in, whispers)}
{238}{}{Yeah?}
{239}{}{I have plenty of connections. For a modest fee of 100 caps, I could be your personal dealer. But it has to stay between us. Get it?}
{240}{}{I'll think about your offer.}
{241}{}{You're a menace to society. You need to be taken out.}
{242}{}{Not so fast. First, tell me where did you get all these drugs?}
{243}{}{Here's the caps. Now show me what you've been hiding from the regulars.}
{244}{}{We've been through this already. So, you want the stuff or not?}
{245}{}{Not today.}
{246}{}{By the way, where do you get these drugs?}
{247}{}{I'm with the Followers. Want the Cathedral to find out about your business? I can arrange that.}
{248}{}{Wait, don't rush! Why go to such extremes? We can always make a deal.}
{249}{}{Then let's see *all* your goods.}
{250}{}{L-listen, I-I'm shaking. Don't leave me hanging, give me some goodies!}
{251}{}{I need something to give me an edge in the arena.}
{252}{}{Why the secrecy? The cultists have bigger problems now, they're not interested in your drugs.}
{253}{}{Let's get straight to it, I'm interested in your wares.}
{254}{}{Stay away from me.}
{255}{}{Orris recommended I come to you for... you know.}
{256}{}{Show me what you've got.}

{260}{}{Alright, I got everything you need. Don't worry, you'll be feeling good soon...}
{261}{}{Whew, so many choices. Now I know where to stock up on drugs.}
{262}{}{That's more like it. But let's definitely keep this our little secret.}
{263}{}{I don't see the point. I don't need a middleman for my supply.}
{264}{}{I'll come back later.}
{265}{}{You're just a fool. Later.}
{266}{}{Then I'll break your fingers.}

{270}{}{Where do you get all this stuff?}
{271}{}{From all over, obviously. I pick up some from scavengers, get some from southern caravans, and cook up a few on my own stove. Don't worry, it's all clean.}
{272}{}{Doesn't sound very reliable, does it?}
{273}{}{Relax. The drugs are almost pure. You won't find better stuff in town... Except maybe from the Followers of Fire, but they don't share with anyone.}
{274}{}{And what kind of "stuff" do you sell?}
{275}{}{Almost? I need *really* quality drugs.}
{276}{}{Like I said, I have the best stuff. Don't trust me? Then get lost.}
{277}{}{Alright, alright, I'm leaving...}
{278}{}{Mouth off to me again and you'll be left without teeth.}
{279}{}{I need *really* quality drugs. Lives depend on it.}
{280}{}{So, are you a doctor? You should have led with that. Medics are rare these days, I'm always happy to meet one. Don't worry, I'll give you my very best stuff. And with a discount too.}
{281}{}{Thanks, that will help a lot.}
{282}{}{That's more like it.}
{283}{}{Still sounds too shady. I'm outta here.}
{284}{}{Murphy sent me. I need something for a... 'permanent' sleep.}
{285}{}{I don't know why you need that, and I don't want to know. But I've got radscorpion venom and Psycho. Take your pick, as long as you've got the caps.}
{286}{}{Let's take a look...}
{287}{}{But if anyone asks, I had nothing to do with this.}
{288}{}{Okay.}

{290}{}{What's your name?}
{291}{}{Call me Gonzales.}
{292}{}{I doubt that's your real name.}
{293}{}{Ha. Sharp as a tack. And why do you care?}
{294}{}{What's with the secrecy?}
{295}{}{There are those who don't like my business. Competitors, damn them. But mostly the cultists from the Cathedral. They want to control all the drug supply, and pay dealers like me peanuts. It's better to work for myself, but you can't explain that to them.}
{296}{}{If you don't get stuff from the Followers, then where do you get it?}
{297}{}{Running your own show in a place like this seems risky.}
{298}{}{Damn, don't twist my balls. You know the Red Cardinals? They usually hang around the old gym. Orris is their leader. He makes sure my business runs smoothly. Not for free, of course.}
{299}{}{Damn, don't twist my balls. I used to be under the protection of Orris' guys. But his death hit my business hard. I don't know how I'll survive now.}

#Addict Killed by Player
{300}{}{Word is you killed Larry. Why are you taking out my customers?}
{301}{}{I'm cleaning up the trash. Got a problem with that?}
{302}{}{Yeah, I do! Larry might've been scum, but he had his moments. He'd sober up just enough to scrape together some caps, then blow 'em on my stuff. Now what am I supposed to do with a dead junkie? Can't make caps off a corpse.}
{303}{}{Huh?}
{304}{}{Not my problem.}
{305}{}{Uh, you'll regret this. I'll be taking my lost profit from our deals.}
{306}{}{So, no more discounts for me? That's a shame.}
{307}{}{I wasn't planning on buying from your shady joint anyway. Later.}
{308}{}{Sorry, it happened by accident.}
{309}{}{Sorry? You killed my customer and say SORRY?! You piece of crap, you think I'm going to let this slide?}
{1309}{}{Sorry? You killed my customer and say SORRY?! You piece of crap, you think I'm going to let this slide?}
{310}{}{Uh, yeah.}
{311}{}{What, you looking to start something?}
{312}{}{It was between me and Larry, not you.}
{313}{}{(narrowing eyes) What kind of business could you possibly have with Larry?}
{314}{}{That's none of your concern.}
{315}{}{If I told you, I'd have to kill you too.}
{316}{}{Damn, I hate when someone messes with my customers.}
{317}{}{You mean that junkie... what's his name... Larry?}
{317}{}{You mean that junkie... Larry, right?}
{318}{}{Yeah, Larry. He might've been trash, but I still made some easy caps off him. What am I gonna do now?}
{319}{}{You wouldn't have made money off him for long. Think about it.}

{320}{}{You should be careful with the guys who took your motorcycle. They're from the Red Cardinals gang, and that gang practically owns this area. Piss one of them off, and you're dead. But that's your call.}
{321}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}
{322}{}{I have a package for you from the Blue Shields.}
{323}{}{Finally. Hand it over. I've been waitin' too long. Do you know how hard it is to get hydrocarbons?}
{324}{}{Uh, how?}
{325}{}{Doesn't matter. Here, take the finished product. And tell your people that it's getting harder to make drugs because of the fire worshippers.}
{326}{}{Later.}
{327}{}{There was a hitch with the last courier. You know how tough it is to travel Route Ten?}
{328}{}{Yeah, whatever. How am I supposed to make drugs without raw materials, huh? Here's the finished product. Give it to Rio and tell him to take care of the courier before the fire worshippers shut me down.}
{329}{}{Later.}

{330}{}{Are you the one supplying Larry with drugs?}
{331}{}{If not me, then someone else. What's it to you?}
{332}{}{Nothing really.}
{333}{}{Then stay out of other people's business.}
{334}{}{Uh, alright...}
{335}{}{The people inside aren't happy about it.}
{336}{}{Let them sort it out. It's not my problem, it's Larry's. I'm just selling him medicine.}
{337}{}{Medicine? Really?}
{338}{}{Well, you know, he had a fever from some wasteland disease. So he came to me for treatment. How could I refuse help to someone in need?}
{339}{}{How "kind" of you. Later, doc.}
{340}{}{If you sell him even one more dose, you'll deal with me.}
{341}{}{What did you say? Repeat that, motherfucker, maybe I misheard you?}
{1341}{}{What did you say? Repeat that, bitch, maybe I misheard you?}
{342}{}{Uh, let's just calm down a bit. Goodbye friend.}
{343}{}{I'll say it just once. Stop poisoning Larry. Or you die.}
{344}{}{Sorry, my mistake. Of course, Larry won't get another dose from me. No problem.}
{345}{}{I'm glad we understand each other.}
{346}{}{Watch yourself. Arguing with me is the same as arguing with Orris.}
{347}{}{Oh, so you're one of the Cardinals now? I'll keep that in mind. Just, uh, don't stress, friend.}
{348}{}{Exactly.}
{349}{}{Larry is under my protection now. Which means he's under Don Diego's protection.}
{350}{}{At any time, I could tell Aaron about your little 'business'. You're lucky I haven't done it yet.}
{1350}{}{At any time, I could tell Aaron about your little 'business'. You're lucky I haven't done it yet.}
