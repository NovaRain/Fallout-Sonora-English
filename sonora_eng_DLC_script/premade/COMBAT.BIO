
PERSONAL BIO DATA:

The strongest in
his community.
With his physique,
he can do the work
of two men. In
brawling, he has no
equal, drawing
strength from his
love for his Villa.
Yet, his violent
nature and lack
of intelligence
limit his reputation.
Still, in the
Wastelands, no one
matches his survival
skills.
