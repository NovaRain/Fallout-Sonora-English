{122}{}{Hey, dude.}
{123}{}{Two heads are better.}
{124}{}{Can you hear us?}
{125}{}{He reads our thoughts.}
{126}{}{Is he listening in on us?}
{127}{}{We know your thoughts.}
{128}{}{I think he's high.}
{129}{}{I won't talk to him.}
{130}{}{If he can hear us, that's bad.}
{131}{}{Let him go.}
{132}{}{He might tell others.}
{133}{}{No one will believe him.}
{134}{}{Right, ignore him.}
{135}{}{Another tramp.}
{136}{}{Isn't he dangerous?}
{137}{}{Hey, shut up.}
{138}{}{He can't hear us.}
{139}{}{This is dangerous, stop.}
{140}{}{Okay, stop thinking.}
{141}{}{I feel sorry for that man.}
{142}{}{People are so fragile.}
{143}{}{People are so wild.}
{144}{}{I don't understand why people hate each other.}
{145}{}{No contact with this creature.}
{146}{}{We might be overheard.}
{147}{}{He thinks he's imagining it.}
{148}{}{Stupid man.}
{149}{}{I think about the eternal.}
{150}{}{Ha! This creature has depressingly low intelligence.}
{151}{}{It appears this poor creature has been lobotomized.}
