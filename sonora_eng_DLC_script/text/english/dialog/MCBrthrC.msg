{100}{}{You see the mutant Edmond.}
{101}{}{You see a horribly disfigured man.}
{102}{}{A mutant suddenly appears from the shadows.}

{110}{}{Go away and don't touch us.}
{111}{}{Leave me alone!}
{112}{}{I don't want to talk to you.}
{113}{}{Strangers can't be trusted.}

{120}{}{Uh-oh! Wow!}
{121}{}{Arrr!}
{122}{}{Arrr!}
{123}{}{Bah! Woman!}

{200}{}{(The mutant blocks your path, brandishing something dangerous.) Ooh! Wooo!}

{201}{}{[Step back, showing your friendliness]}
{202}{}{Arrr! (Sensing your softness and reluctance to fight, the mutant decides to attack!)}
{203}{}{No, don't touch me!}
{204}{}{Mutant freak!}
{205}{}{Stop! Not another step!}
{206}{}{(Your words only anger the mutant, and he decides to attack!)}

{210}{}{[Take a provocative step forward]}
{211}{}{Arrr! (The mutant backs away, his gaze becoming even crazier)}
{212}{}{Listen, I don't want a fight. Trust me.}
{213}{}{Die, mutant!}
{214}{}{Stop! Not a step further!}

{220}{}{(The mutant abruptly brakes and takes a step back. Your determination seems to frighten him.)}
{221}{}{What's wrong, handsome? Don't want a fight, right?}
{222}{}{That's better. And don't even twitch, you piece of shit.}
{223}{}{(The mutant stands numb and indecisive. You look closely at his disfigured face, etched with horror and years of pain. His body is thin and distorted.)}
{224}{}{Huh, no wonder you're holed up in the basement while everyone else is fighting upstairs. How did you even survive with such symptoms?}
{225}{}{Poor thing, were you born like this? It's a miracle you're still alive at all.}
{226}{}{(Suddenly, from the next room, someone's hysterical crying is heard. The sound brings the mutant to his senses, and he takes a defensive position, blocking the passage.)}
{227}{}{Who's there? Who are you torturing?}
{228}{}{Arrr! (Gestures for you to leave)}
{229}{}{Answer me, motherfucker!}
{230}{}{Arrr! Arrr!}
{231}{}{God damn son of a bitch! Die!}
{232}{}{Step aside and stay out of the way, you piece of shit.}
{233}{}{You can't speak? Then I'll go through you and find out what's going on.}
{234}{}{(He shakes his head pitifully)}
{235}{}{Get out of here. If you come back, you'll die. Got it?}
{236}{}{I won't kill you if you leave and don't interfere. Go on, get some fresh air.}
