{100}{}{You see Randy.}
{101}{}{You see an unwashed farmer. He smells terrible.}
{102}{}{They're over there. Be careful.}
{103}{}{Nice to see you. But I need to tend to my farm now.}

{200}{}{(the disheveled man looks at you with sad eyes) Hello, stranger. I want to say right off the bat that I have nothing valuable.}
{1200}{}{(the disheveled man looks at you with sad eyes) Hello, stranger. I want to say right off the bat that I have nothing valuable.}
{201}{}{That's what everyone says. Show me what you're hiding.}
{202}{}{I'm telling you, there's nothing. The raiders kicked me out of my own home. I'm poor and homeless.}
{203}{}{Ugh, you're disgusting to look at.}
{204}{}{Sorry to hear that. But I need to talk to you.}
{205}{}{I see you're on edge. Calm down, I'm not going to rob you.}
{206}{}{Sorry. I lost my trust in people after the raiders kicked me out of the farm. Now I'm poor and homeless, as you can see.}
{207}{}{Sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I sit next to you?}
{208}{}{Then I don't need you. Move on with your sorrows, loser.}
{209}{}{Okay, no more questions.}
{210}{}{Yes?}
{211}{}{Nothing, bye.}
{212}{}{Who are you?}
{213}{}{I'm Randy. Came with the colonists a few years ago and set up a small farm away from everyone. Doubt you'll be interested in the rest of my story.}
{214}{}{So, the raiders kicked you out of your house?}
{215}{}{Yeah, those smart-ass guys know how to ambush. I was in their hands faster than I could say "mole rats." They turned the whole house over looking for food. Then they threw me out and said I don't live there anymore.}
{216}{}{Have you tried to get them out?}
{217}{}{One against three armed raiders is too much. Better to lose your home than your life.}
{218}{}{Why not ask the garrison for help?}
{219}{}{Because then I'd have to give them almost all of my harvest for ten years. Those are the conditions. But my farm can only feed a couple of people, no more.}
{220}{}{I'll solve the problem with the raiders if you give me some food.}
{221}{}{Our problems are somewhat similar. I want to help you.}
{222}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{223}{}{Did the raiders kick you out of your house?}
{224}{}{Yeah, sure. The farm has small food supplies. And in any case, they will go to someone. But not to me.}
{225}{}{Show the way.}
{226}{}{It's a tempting offer, but I don't want to mess with the raiders.}
{227}{}{Are you going to drive them away? That would be very helpful. I hope you know how to fight, because it's hardly possible to come to an agreement with them.}
{228}{}{I'll find a way. Just show me the way.}
{229}{}{Indeed, this is too dangerous for one person. Sorry, I can't help.}

#Dialogue - on the farm map
{300}{}{They're over there. Be careful.}
{301}{}{Wait here.}

{310}{}{Is this your farm?}
{311}{}{Of course. This is my home and my garden beds.}
{312}{}{Do you live here alone?}
{313}{}{Yeah, recently. At first, there were more of us. One was killed by thieves for the harvest, another died from some infection. So, gradually, I was left alone. But I still don't want to leave here.}
{314}{}{Why is this farm so important to you? There are a lot of abandoned lands and houses around.}
{315}{}{This land started to bear fruit only thanks to our sweat and blood! I put in too much work to give it to some thieves. They'll leave someday anyway.}
{316}{}{Why is there a Morrison Brothers sign at the entrance?}
{317}{}{(confused) Morrison... Never mind. This sign is probably a hundred years old. Now *I* own this land!}
{318}{}{What do you know about the raiders?}
{319}{}{They lived here before us. Savages, that is. They didn't adapt to the new life, but they learned to rob. The garrison guards brought out almost everyone, but this gang turned out to be too tenacious.}
{320}{}{You didn't mention that.}
{321}{}{Why? Listen, they are simple raiders. They come and take what doesn't belong to them. Nothing else matters.}

{350}{}{The raiders are dead, Randy. You can go back to your sweet home.}
{351}{}{I can't believe you pulled it off. Eh, I could use your skills... Maybe you can move in with me for good, huh?}
{352}{}{I can't. I also have a home. And it's in danger.}
{353}{}{Into this hole? No way. In my home village, there are plantations like you never dreamed of.}
{354}{}{Well, if that's the case... I understand. Thank you for your help and good luck.}
{355}{}{Not so fast. Hand over all the food you have.}
{356}{}{Glad to help.}
{1356}{}{I was glad to help.}
{357}{}{Ah, of course. I get it. Some raiders push out others. The cycle repeats. Nothing changes, right? You can take whatever's left in that refrigerator.}
{358}{}{That would be right away.}
{359}{}{Those savages won't bother you anymore. You can go back to your house.}
