{102}{}{I won't tolerate this in my casino. Leave your toys outside.}
{103}{}{Are you threatening me?}

#Acquaintance
{200}{}{It takes balls of steel to barge in on me so brazenly. Who are you? What do you want?}
{1200}{}{It takes nerves of steel to barge in on me so brazenly. Who are you? What do you want?}
{201}{}{I'm }
{202}{}{ from Villa. And I want to work for you, Don Diego.}
{203}{}{Many say that and then run at the first sign of trouble. This casino is family, not just a money-maker. I need solid reasons to accept you.}
{204}{}{If you need reasons, I'll find a way to make a few. See you soon, Don Diego.}
{205}{}{Bill warned me about your arrival. Who are you? What do you want?}
{206}{}{Don Diego, please listen. Slavers took my kin, and I'm trying to fix things.}
{207}{}{Then why not ask Aaron for help? His cult supplies caps to slavers. I've no reason to be involved.}
{208}{}{Sorry to hear that. Goodbye, Don Diego.}
{209}{}{Interesting. Are you asking for my help?}
{210}{}{I'm suggesting cooperation. We share a common enemy - the fire worshippers.}
{211}{}{Then you're talking business. But this casino is family, not just business. I won't risk my "family" in a direct fight. Nevertheless, Aaron's pressure is growing, and one day I might have to act. But not yet.}
{212}{}{Let's hope when you do act, it's not too late. Goodbye, Don Diego.}
{213}{}{Maybe I could work for you then. Give me a chance. You won't regret it.}
{214}{}{I'm not asking for help. I'm asking for justice, Don Diego.}
{215}{}{I was once like you, just a peasant. Took a lot to get out of that hole and gain a foothold here.}
{216}{}{So you understand.}
{217}{}{But that was a long time ago. You endear me, but I need solid reasons to trust you.}
{218}{}{Check me out. I'll prove your mistrust is misplaced.}
{219}{}{I'm really sorry to hear that. Goodbye, Don Diego.}
{220}{}{Talk to Garcia. He'll give you a couple of tasks to start. Let's see how you do.}
{221}{}{I won't let you down, Don Diego.}
{222}{}{Okay. Whatever you say.}
{223}{}{Sorry, but I don't have any work for you right now.}
{224}{}{I see. Then I'll say goodbye.}

{250}{}{What do you want?}
{251}{}{Tell me what you want.}
{252}{}{Well, what is it?}
{253}{}{My respects, Don Diego.}

{260}{}{Don Diego, what do you intend to do now that the Cathedral is destroyed?}
{261}{}{You ask questions beyond your status.}
{262}{}{Sorry, Don Diego.}
{263}{}{Just curious.}
{264}{}{Same as before. Earn money, expand influence. Now it's easier than ever.}
{265}{}{The Cult of Fire was a thorn in your side, wasn't it?}
{266}{}{The fire worshippers' fall opens up opportunities, but it's a blow to many in the city. Maintaining the cap currency's value, job losses, increased crime - all need rethinking. But yes, it works for me.}
{267}{}{Thanks for your answer, Don Diego.}

#Attack on Followers
{300}{}{I'm investigating an attack on some Followers. What do you know about it?}
{301}{}{You think you can barge in and interrogate me? Guys, throw this pest out.}
{302}{}{Just try it!}
{303}{}{Okay, I'm leaving.}
{304}{}{Is barging in with interrogations the norm for Followers now? I'll answer out of respect for the church that feeds the city.}
{305}{}{Great, let me turn on my pipboy... Let's begin.}
{306}{}{I know nothing of this... business.}
{307}{}{Uh, what?}
{308}{}{Someone surrounded the monks on the street and shot them point-blank. I wasn't there. Rumors abound, but my people aren't involved. That's all I know.}
{309}{}{Sorry, Don Diego. Now I see I'm wasting your time.}
{310}{}{Good luck with your investigation. But don't bother me again about this.}
{311}{}{Goodbye.}
{312}{}{Do you and your people have any alibi?}
{313}{}{What's our alibi? Our casino owes the Church of the Holy Fire. They regulate the cap value and provide jobs. No point in cutting down the brahmin we milk. It wasn't us.}
{314}{}{Hmm, so no alibi... I'll leave, but I've got my eye on you.}
{315}{}{That's pretty clear. Goodbye.}
{316}{}{Okay, Don Diego, let's speak frankly.}
{317}{}{Hey Garcia, what's this peasant saying? He thinks he can talk to me as an equal? Throw him out.}
{1317}{}{Hey Garcia, what's this peasant girl saying? She thinks she can talk to me as an equal? Throw her out.}
{318}{}{(nods) You should know, young cultist, many in the city... dislike the Followers.}
{319}{}{Why?}
{320}{}{First the bloody revolution that brought Aaron to power. Much unfinished business there. Then his mass inquisition to solidify control. People won't forget. Those you seek are organized and well-armed. Not simple gangsters or mercenaries.}
{321}{}{Interesting points. I'll think about them.}
{322}{}{Well organized and armed. Just like your casino... No, no, I'm not accusing you. Goodbye, Don Diego.}
