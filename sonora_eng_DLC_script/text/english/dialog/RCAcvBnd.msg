{100}{}{You see Keel.}
{101}{}{In front of you stands a guy in a leather jacket. He's casually playing with his spear.}
{102}{}{Everyone's better off if you just leave.}
{103}{}{Ugh... think I had too much...}

{110}{}{What do you want, huh?}
{111}{}{Best not mess with the locals around here.}
{112}{}{I don't recognize you.}
{113}{}{Move along, stranger.}
{114}{}{Only decent folks fit in at the Aqueduct.}
{115}{}{Doubt you'll find a place to rest around here.}
{116}{}{Just a heads-up - thieves around here lose their hands.}

#Dialogue
{200}{}{Hold it. What are you doing here?}
{201}{}{None of your business.}
{202}{}{Wrong answer. You're going to regret that...}
{203}{}{Hey, wait...}
{204}{}{Just try it.}
{205}{}{There's a pile of bodies below. Know anything about that?}
{206}{}{Ah, yeah. Must be those idiots who were told to stay out of the aqueduct. Didn't listen. Just like you.}
{207}{}{They were killed. Not by a beast, but by a man.}
{208}{}{Aren't you sharp? So, what's your next move, genius?}
{209}{}{I'll kill everyone involved. Starting with you.}
{210}{}{Garth was right about you being dangerous. Come on, outsider, try me.}
{1210}{}{Garth was right about you being dangerous. Come on, outsider, try me.}
{211}{}{Your funeral...}
{212}{}{I ended up here by accident. How about I just leave and we forget all this?}
{213}{}{You really that naive? Garth ordered me to kill you if you sniffed anything out. Sorry, nothing personal...}
{1213}{}{You really that naive? Garth ordered me to kill you if you sniffed anything out. Sorry, nothing personal...}
{214}{}{Wait, I don't want a fight...}
{215}{}{You're not leaving me any choice.}
{216}{}{You seriously think you can take me with just a spear?}
{217}{}{This spear's put down plenty of folks. You ready to be next?}
{218}{}{Oh, this'll be fun. Show me what you got...}
{219}{}{Ranger HQ knows my location. You want that kind of heat?}
{220}{}{No... I don't want trouble. But there will be, once Garth finds out.}
{221}{}{I can stop this. Garth crossed a line a Ranger can't cross. Don't you see?}
{222}{}{Enough talk. Let's see if you can back it up.}
{223}{}{Now I see you're a real threat to our peaceful town. Garth didn't just kill those wasteland scum for no reason. We don't need your kind. Go to hell, you bastard...}
{224}{}{Your funeral...}
{225}{}{Wait... So Garth's behind all this? We need to stop him. He crossed a line a Ranger can't cross. You understand that, right?}
{226}{}{Well... Garth's losing it. He used to handle real threats, but now he kills anyone who looks at him wrong. I agree, it's too much. Do what you have to.}
{227}{}{Thanks, I'll handle it. You're alright.}
{228}{}{On second thought, I don't trust you. Better to take you out right now...}
{229}{}{I'll have to report this to the Rangers HQ.}
{230}{}{Garth said to kill you if you sniffed anything out. Sorry. Nothing personal...}
{231}{}{You're going to kill a Ranger?}
{232}{}{I have no choice. Garth ordered me to stop you. If I don't, it'll be bad for all of us.}
{233}{}{Well then. You're a fool, and you'll die a fool...}
{234}{}{Really? You're going to kill a lady? You're no man!}
{235}{}{Damn it, I really don't want to hit a woman. But what choice do I have? Garth doesn't forgive mistakes, and you shouldn't have stuck your nose where it doesn't belong...}
{236}{}{Come on then, tough guy, do your worst.}

{240}{}{Whoa, whoa, hold up. I don't want any trouble. But Garth ordered me to stop you.}
{241}{}{Stop me? Your spear won't pierce Power Armor. Good to know you're not suicidal.}
{242}{}{What are you gonna do? You gonna kill us all or turn us in?}
{243}{}{Kill you all. And you'll be the first...}
{244}{}{First tell me what happened. There are bodies below. And they weren't killed by a beast.}
{245}{}{Garth's getting rid of outsiders he thinks don't deserve to live here. At first, he solved real problems that way. But now something's broken in him, he cuts down anyone who seems suspicious.}
{246}{}{That's a sick story. I'll make sure Garth pays for this, and you too...}
{247}{}{So you're his lackey? Listen, we need to stop him.}
{248}{}{I just do his dirty work. Hope you know what to do.}
{249}{}{Stay here and keep your head down. Pray the Rangers give you a fair trial.}
{250}{}{I know. I'll kill him and you. And you're first in line.}

{260}{}{Hold it, mutie freak. You look like you crawled out of a gutter. What are you doing here?}
{1260}{}{Hold it, mutie freak. You look like you crawled out of a gutter. What are you doing here?}
