{100}{}{You see Sentry Davis before you.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary mercenary maintaining order in the garrison.}
{102}{}{Enough! I'll pay you off if you calm down!}

{200}{}{Hold it! What's your business in the garrison?}
{201}{}{None of your concern.}
{202}{}{I think my people are being held here.}
{203}{}{Nothing really. Now let me through.}
{204}{}{Fine, come on in. I don't really care, but I'm supposed to ask.}
{205}{}{Alright.}
{206}{}{You're not allowed to wander around outside at night. Get back to the barracks before I put a hole in your head.}

{210}{}{What's the matter?}
{211}{}{I settled your debt with the bar. Now you owe me.}
{1211}{}{I settled your debt with the bar. Now you owe me.}
{212}{}{Nothing important.}
{213}{}{Ha! You'll never see those caps.}
{214}{}{Why can't you just pay off the debt?}
{215}{}{Pay your debts, or you'll end up doing hard labor in the mine.}
{216}{}{If that's the case, then I'll have to take them by force.}
{217}{}{We'll see about that later.}

{218}{}{Why should I bother? My position here makes it easier to take than to give. Do you want to test that theory?}
{219}{}{You're under the same thumb too. If you don't return the caps, you'll end up doing hard labor.}
{220}{}{There's no point in talking to you. I'll just take the caps by force.}
{221}{}{I'm not interested anymore. Goodbye.}

{222}{}{You're bluffing. There's a whole army of mercenaries behind me.}
{223}{}{Well, we'll see.}
{224}{}{You'd better disappear before I lose my temper.}
{225}{}{Calm down, no need for threats... Here's the caps. Now leave me alone, okay?}
{226}{}{That's what I thought.}
{227}{}{Here, here! Take the caps, just leave me alone!}
{228}{}{That's what I thought.}
{229}{}{Alright. I don't want any trouble.}

// added for the case that the player robs him of the money before asking for it - cambragol
{230}{}{What!? I never asked for that shit. Besides, someone robbed me blind. I'm broke.}
{231}{}{For some reason I believe you. Consider yourself lucky.}
