{102}{}{This is for my difficult childhood, padre!}
{103}{}{Goodbye. I don't need my father's lessons anymore.}
{104}{}{Are you alright in the head? Go to the wasteland and bury this... "tin can" somewhere deep.}
{105}{}{Your padre has returned to the Villa.}
{106}{}{I'm proud of you, son.}
{1106}{}{I'm proud of you, daughter.}
{107}{}{I no longer have a son. You are a stranger to me.}
{1107}{}{I no longer have a daughter. You are a stranger to me.}
{108}{}{If you want to leave, leave. But don't try to lead the others astray.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Your return brought joy to the entire Villa. I'm proud of you.}
{201}{}{That's... good to hear.}
{206}{}{What happened to you?}
{207}{}{Are you talking about my skin? Nothing.}
{208}{}{I truly hope it's not contagious. Believe me, to protect the community, I would sacrifice anything, or anyone. Enough about that for now.}
{209}{}{Thanks for your honesty... padre.}

#Re-dialogue
{210}{}{Speak, I'm listening.}
{211}{}{Never mind, I'd better go.}
{212}{}{More?}

{220}{}{Padre, why have we always lived isolated from the rest of the world?}
{221}{}{Too much contact with outsiders brings nothing good. This is what the Founder taught. Remember the settlements you've visited. People are divided and cannot coexist in peace and harmony like we do.}
{222}{}{[More]}

{228}{}{I demand an explanation - why is a stranger in a white robe wandering our plaza and staring at our houses?}
{229}{}{Arthur Carrington is a scientist. It seemed his help would be useful in restoring the Villa after the raid.}
{230}{}{Help from someone who can read and do math but can't hold a shovel?}
{231}{}{He's a bit weak, true, but he knows much about the outside world. And he understands old technologies. With their help, we...}
{232}{}{I can't believe my ears! Has your journey through the desert clouded your mind? We've lived for generations in isolation, and you bring a stranger here and suggest embracing old technologies? Pray that your decision isn't a mistake. I'll be watching this stranger. And you.}
{233}{}{You won't regret it.}
{234}{}{You know, the community intends to punish Chris for his cowardice.}
{235}{}{Villa has always followed the will of the majority. This is our law. It's how we've survived in the desert. Chris's story shows the importance of unity.}
{236}{}{}
{237}{}{}
{238}{}{That's why we avoided contact with outsiders - to keep our world untarnished by their selfishness. Letting them in brings nothing but discord. Keep this in mind when you talk with others in the Villa.}
{239}{}{I see.}

{240}{}{I need supplies and reliable weapons for my mission.}
{241}{}{(nods) I agree. It's time to give you some of our relics. In my office on the second floor, there's a safe with valuable Old World items. Take what you need. The code is 2093. That's the year the Founder came here and grew the first corn.}
{242}{}{I won't disgrace our Founder and will fight for our freedom.}
{243}{}{Thank you.}

#Quests
{250}{}{Is there anything else I can do to help?}
{251}{}{Some of our people are still held by the Flagstaff colonists. Villa needs me too much right now. You must save them.}
{252}{}{Alright, I'll get them back here.}
{253}{}{What?! It took so much to free you from Two-Sun, and now Flagstaff...}
{254}{}{There's no choice! This is your duty as the future leader. Do what you MUST do!}
{1254}{}{There's no choice! This is your duty as the future leader. Do what you MUST do!}
{255}{}{Your madre hasn't returned from Flagstaff. I'm afraid she's still in the slavers' clutches. You've got to save her at all costs!}
{256}{}{You can count on me, Padre.}
{257}{}{Madre... is dead. She won't be coming home.}
{258}{}{Talk to the people. Maybe I don't know everything happening in the Villa.}
{259}{}{Okay.}
{260}{}{(takes a deep breath, closing his eyes) Maria... Do you know that for sure? Well, it's better the rest don't know yet. News like that could make life even harder.}
{261}{}{What do we do now?}
{262}{}{We have much to do. Raiders plundered the settlement, rats infested the cellars, the plantations fell into disrepair, but we must be ready for new threats.}
{263}{}{[More]}
{264}{}{The community must decide. We're holding a council meeting at the town hall. Your experience in the wasteland will be invaluable. Don't be late.}
{265}{}{Okay, I'll be there.}
{266}{}{Talk to people, I might not know everything in the Villa. And don't forget the meeting. Your input will be crucial.}
{267}{}{Okay, I'll be there.}

{270}{}{The Council wants to blow up the Flagstaff mine. What do you think?}
{271}{}{It's risky, but necessary. No one but you can handle it. If we leave the mine, slavery will expand and reach us again. We can't handle that.}
{272}{}{I see.}
{273}{}{The Council has decided to destroy the Garage City factory. What do you think?}
{274}{}{The scavengers deserve it. They betrayed us by aiding the raiders. Restarting the factory will cost us our privacy, peace, and way of life. It should be destoryed.}
{275}{}{I see.}
{276}{}{How do you feel about an alliance with the Rangers?}
{277}{}{The Rangers have their own goals. But we need allies to improve our security. No one better than the Rangers. We can only hope they limit themselves to protection in exchange for food.}
{278}{}{Perhaps you're right, padre.}
{279}{}{How do you feel about an alliance with the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{280}{}{Seems like we have no choice, do we? Well, if we can't beat the enemy, we make him our friend.}
{281}{}{Good answer, Padre.}

# Background of the Villa
{300}{}{I know about the Founder's records. I read them.}
{301}{}{Well, I thought it was too early for you to know about such things. The rest of the residents shouldn't read them either - no point in loading their heads with questions meant for leaders. And you, as the future leader, should treat his words, his wisdom, with all due attention and respect.}
{302}{}{Do you completely agree with what he wrote?}
{303}{}{Of course. We've followed his testament for generations and must continue to do so. The Founder was wise, shaped by a harsh life. If he tells us to avoid ancient technology, it makes sense. If he says to cultivate corn, then we will do it well. If he warns us to drive away outsiders, the raid proves his point.}
{304}{}{I see.}
{305}{}{I happened to visit Vault 27. You never talked about it.}
{306}{}{What are you talking about?! The same Vault our ancestors came from?}
{307}{}{Exactly. As the Founder said, it's a treasure trove of ancient technologies...}
{308}{}{Shut up! The Founder left the Vault for a reason. And you already know why. Don't bring up the past. Forget everything you saw and heard there.}
{1308}{}{Shut up! The Founder left the Vault for a reason. And you already know why. Don't bring up the past. Forget everything you saw and heard there.}
{309}{}{Why are you so afraid of the past?}

{310}{}{The Founder believed the community should abandon technology and rely on manual labor. He avoided talking about the Vault and its technology.}
{311}{}{But it's not just about that, is it? He stole some kind of Garden of Eden Creation Kit and doomed everyone else he left behind, to suffer.}
{312}{}{(heated) It doesn't matter! He saved his people! (calming down) Hard times called for hard decisions. The Founder lived with this burden until his end. But he created Villa and gave life to this desert. If anyone calls his actions a crime, I'll personally tear out their tongue.}
{313}{}{But padre...}
{314}{}{I understand. You won't hear about it again.}

{315}{}{Enough! Don't discuss this with anyone. The other villagers won't understand, and neither I, nor the elders want to know of it.}
{316}{}{As you say, padre.}
{317}{}{Hmph. I'll think about it.}
{318}{}{Thank you. Don't discuss this with anyone. The other villagers won't understand, and neither I, nor the elders want to know of it.}
