{100}{}{You see a townsperson.}
{101}{}{You see a typical citizen of Casa Grande.}
{102}{}{Thanks for saving my neck! I'll tell the others about you.}
{103}{}{These scorpions come out of nowhere. Stay sharp.}
{104}{}{Those highwaymen are probably hiding close by. Keep your eyes open.}

{110}{}{Help!}
{111}{}{Hey, somebody!}
{112}{}{Scram, damn radscorpions!}
{113}{}{Get lost, radscorps!}
{114}{}{You can't get me, you pests!}
{115}{}{I'll wait here till they clear out.}
{116}{}{Is anyone looking for me?}
{117}{}{Hey, can anyone hear me?}
{118}{}{Help, I'm trapped!}
{119}{}{Someone help!}

{120}{}{Help!}
{121}{}{Hey, somebody!}
{122}{}{Over here!}
{123}{}{I was locked up by highwaymen.}
{124}{}{I'm starving.}
{125}{}{Is anyone coming to save me?}
{126}{}{Is anyone looking for me?}
{127}{}{Hey, can anyone hear me?}
{128}{}{Help, I'm trapped!}
{129}{}{Someone help!}

{200}{}{Finally. I thought no one would find me.}
{201}{}{What are you doing here?}
{202}{}{Hiding from the radscorpions, obviously. They almost surrounded me while I was catching iguanas. Lucky to find this shack in time.}
{203}{}{How long have you been stuck here?}
{204}{}{Seems like ages. These scorpions are patient. They can bake in the sun for days. I thought I'd starve before they left.}
{205}{}{Want to head back to town?}
{206}{}{Absolutely. Is the coast clear? If it is, I'm right behind you.}
{207}{}{Stay put, I'll take care of these pests first.}
{208}{}{Alright, let's head back. They're probably looking for you by now.}
{209}{}{Yeah... (peeks out cautiously) You go first.}
{210}{}{Of course.}
{211}{}{Lead the way.}
{212}{}{Think again. I'm a raider, not a savior. Hand over everything valuable.}
{213}{}{Please, I have nothing!}
{214}{}{That's what I thought.}
{215}{}{Forget it. You're not worth the trouble.}
{216}{}{What's out there? Is it safe to go?}
{217}{}{Nope, still scorpions out there. Sit tight and stay low.}

{300}{}{Finally. Thought no one would come.}
{301}{}{Who locked you in here?}
{302}{}{Highwaymen. Blue Shields I think. They caught me in the desert, thought I'd warn the town about them. Tied me up instead of killing me.}
{303}{}{Did you hear them say where they went?}
{304}{}{Yeah, they're planning something big. That caravan attack was just a distraction. They left most of the goods, except the weapons.}
{305}{}{We need to warn the mayor. Let's head to town.}
{306}{}{The highwaymen might still be around. Stay put for now.}
{307}{}{What's out there? Can I go out?}
{308}{}{Let's go. We need to tell Count Bustos what happened.}
{309}{}{It's still dangerous out there. Better stay here a while longer.}
