1. The system requirements are the same as Fallout 2.

2. "Fallout: Sonora" is not compatible with mods, add-ons and patches for the games Fallout and Fallout 2.

3. We strongly recommend playing "Fallout: Sonora" in the original screen resolution of 640x480 on monitors with a diameter of about 17 inches and an aspect ratio of 3x4. Playing in high resolutions adversely affects the perception of the game and gameplay.
