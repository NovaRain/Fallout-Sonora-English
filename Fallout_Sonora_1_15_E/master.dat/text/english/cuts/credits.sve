130: War.
155: War never changes.
225: That's what our ancestors always said.
290: They learned it from the countless wars of the past:
385: from ancient tribes to Nazi Germany -
445: humans have always fought to seize each other's resources.
565: Petroleum and uranium were the coveted spoils of the last great wars.
690: In the struggle for these dwindling riches, nations took up arms once again.
820: But this time, the blazing flames of battle couldn't be quenched,
900: and soon the world was plunged into chaos...
980:
1035: But war never changes.
1100: People knew this.
1145: Yet the wisdom of time failed the thinkers,
1228: while the politicians and generals devised their inhuman plans.
1300:
1354: Their insatiable ambition spawned a monster,
1410: which lurked quietly until Judgment Day.
1485: And in 2077, the monster broke free.
1570:
1610: It was a weapon of incredible power, destroying entire cities
1715: and leaving only scorched deserts where they once stood.
1810: Whole continents were engulfed in flames cast down from the heavens.
1947: In less than two hours, the world was almost completely destroyed.
2050:
2124: Only a few survived, finding refuge in underground Vaults.
2255: For many years they languished, waiting for the monster outside to settle.
2383: When the smoke finally cleared,
2433: a new civilization slowly began to rise from the radioactive debris.
2587: One of the survivors was your distant ancestor.
2668: He gathered the best and brightest, leading them to the "Gardens of Eden" -- 
2786: a unique haven in the scorched desert, where the soil could still yield crops.
2900:
3005: And so Villa emerged -- your home and the home of your close-knit commune.
3110:
3162: For generations, peace and tranquility reigned here.
3240: The commune avoided other communities
3281: and successfully repelled the occasional attacks of raiders and mutants
3370: who wandered into this sparsely populated area.
3455: But the earth has not forgotten the wounds of the past.
3548: They say the demon is awakening from its long slumber.
3678: If so, then life in Villa is about to change...
3785: Forever.
