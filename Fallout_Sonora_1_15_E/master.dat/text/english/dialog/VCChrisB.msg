{100}{}{You see Chris.}
{101}{}{You see one of the residents of the Villa. His expression reveals a fair amount of puzzlement.}

{110}{}{Chris' backpack is now filled with supplies.}
{111}{}{Thanks, that's enough... I hope.}
{112}{}{(}
{113}{}{/}
{114}{}{) of Chris' backpack is filled with supplies, but not enough for the journey.}
{115}{}{Thanks. At least I won't starve.}

{200}{}{, it's you... Not surprising. I figured it'd be you, the new hero of the Villa, sent on the search. Now you're seen as a leader. You probably don't want to lose that special status, right?}
{201}{}{So why did you run away from the community?}
{202}{}{They want to punish me. You know why. Why ask if you already know?}
{203}{}{I needed to know for sure.}
{204}{}{You better stay here. Wait for my return.}

{210}{}{If this is my last day, I'd rather spend it with you.}
{211}{}{If this is my last day, I'd rather see him at the bottom of a well than next to you.}
{212}{}{Don't go anywhere, I'll be back soon.}
{213}{}{I think I missed something in this story. Tell me what's going on.}
{214}{}{Okay. There's no rush anyway.}
{215}{}{Go on.}

{220}{}{Why are they angry with you?}
{221}{}{Like you, I 'missed' the raiders. But I wasn't away from the village, I just hid in the cellars. The people can't forgive that and think I'm a... a traitor. And traitors? They never lasted long in the Villa.}
{222}{}{What kind of punishment are they planning?}
{223}{}{I don't know for sure, but I heard whispers about stoning. That's how they used to do it. Now, after this raid, they might come up with something worse.}
{224}{}{What do you know about this place?}
{225}{}{These are ancient ruins of some old settlement. Our ancestors took bricks from here to build their homes. The rest has been worn away by time. There's almost nothing left...}
{226}{}{[More]}
{227}{}{Funny, isn't it? The Villa stands because of these ruins. And now, they're keeping me alive. But nobody knows a damn thing about the people who once lived here. Maybe, in another town - one that's not like the Villa - I could finally find my place.}
{228}{}{What are you going to do?}
{229}{}{I don't know. I can't hide forever, and there's nowhere to run. I've heard about the Rangers, and the scavengers in the next town. But to get there, I need supplies. (bitter laugh) I'm sure as hell not getting those from the Villa.}
{230}{}{If I get you supplies, you can leave and never come back.}
{231}{}{I know! Maybe this is what I've always wanted, but was too afraid to admit. Most of our people never tried to learn anything about the outside world. They've lived their way for decades and are ready to throw stones at any change... I want to be free, amigo. Give me a chance!}

{232}{}{Alright, I'll get you supplies for your journey. Wait here.}
{233}{}{No. My reputation matters. And you deserve punishment. Get ready, we're heading back to the Villa.}
{234}{}{I need to get the full story first.}
{1234}{}{I need to get the full story first.}
{235}{}{To transfer supplies to Chris, use them on his character.}
{236}{}{This should be enough to get you to the nearest town.}
{237}{}{I hope so. Let's get some fresh air. I want to look around one last time before leaving.}
{238}{}{Let's go.}
{239}{}{Escort Chris to the Villa plaza.}

#GG takes Chris away from the location:
{240}{}{Should we talk outside?}
{241}{}{Let's go.}
{242}{}{Don't worry about me, I'll find my way.}
{243}{}{Alright.}
{244}{}{Escort Chris to the edge of the ruins, then return to the Villa.}
{245}{}{Go on, do what you've gotta do!}
{1245}{}{Go on, do what you've gotta do!}
{246}{}{You'd better shut up.}
{247}{}{Look, I'm not thrilled about this either.}
