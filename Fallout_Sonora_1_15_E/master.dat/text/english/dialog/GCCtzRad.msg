{100}{}{You see a sick scavenger.}
{101}{}{You see one of Trayvon's scavengers, clearly suffering from some illness.}
{102}{}{You have successfully cured the scavenger.}
{103}{}{You can't diagnose the disease, let alone cure it without proper medication.}
{104}{}{This scavenger is suffering from radiation sickness. Your skills aren't enough to cure him without special meds.}

{110}{}{*Cough cough*}
{111}{}{Sorry, I'm not feeling well.}
{112}{}{I got sick after another trip into the ruins.}
{113}{}{*hack* ...I'm sick, as you can see.}
{114}{}{...It's not contagious, don't worry.}

{115}{}{Thanks for your help, I was already kissing my ass goodbye.}
{116}{}{If it weren't for you, I'd have suffered until I was gone.}
{117}{}{Healers like you amaze me.}
{118}{}{I got sick after another trip into the ruins.}
{119}{}{Are you looking for your people? They were taken east, that's all I know.}

{120}{}{Oh...}
{121}{}{*Cough cough*}
{122}{}{*Hack*}
{123}{}{Ugh...}
{124}{}{*Moan*}
{125}{}{Hrr...}
