{100}{}{You see Ronnie.}
{101}{}{You see a leather craftsman. With a professional movement of his hand, he cleans a piece of leather.}
{102}{}{Listen, iron spirit, leave our peaceful village alone.}

{200}{}{Greetings, stranger. I hope you came to us with good intentions?}
{1200}{}{Greetings, stranger. I hope you came to us with good intentions?}
{201}{}{Sure. Who are you? And what is this place?}
{202}{}{I did, just wanted to meet you.}
{203}{}{I am Ronnie and this is my leather workshop.}
{204}{}{Looks like you're set up pretty well here, Ronnie.}
{205}{}{Correct. I used to travel throughout the Sonoran Desert and herd brahmin like the others. And now I sit here and prepare leather for my fellow tribesmen and for sale.}
{206}{}{Seems like an important job, Ronnie.}
{207}{}{Must be a good business.}
{208}{}{I see. But right now I don't need leather goods. Bye.}

{210}{}{How can I help you?}
{211}{}{See you later.}
{212}{}{Ah, I see my work. I mark all armor I craft with special 'symbol'.}
{213}{}{Welcome, Ranger. How can I help you, friend of my tribe?}
{214}{}{Ah, another ambassador of strange religion. What does your church want from my tribe this time?}

{220}{}{Why did you stop trading with Garage City?}
{221}{}{Our elders made decision. They do not like that outsiders bring discord into our lives and cheat and steal our brahmin. So, we have closed trade routes with Phoenix and all its colonies.}
{222}{}{Does this apply to Garage City?}
{223}{}{The elders know best. Talk to them. Until they agree, I cannot trade with that city.}
{224}{}{I see. I'll try to convince them.}
{225}{}{Chief Geronimo agreed to restart trade.}
{226}{}{Chief Chatto agreed to restart trade.}
{227}{}{There is no High Chief yet. Don't miss your chance sell your wares.}
{228}{}{I hope this is all just work of Divine Brahmin. Tell the residents of Garage City to send someone to make deal.}
{229}{}{Sounds good.}

{230}{}{Can you make bags for my bike?}
{231}{}{That is my craft. I will do it in the best possible way, your bike will turn into whole caravan. But such work is takes times and effort. What can you offer in return?}
{232}{}{Let's see...}
{233}{}{My workshop is closed to outsiders. I work only for my fellow tribesmen and those outsiders who are trusted by elders.}
{234}{}{So, I have to deal with the local crap first? Yeesh.}
{235}{}{I'll talk to them later.}

{240}{}{I wanted to look at your wares. Can I?}
{241}{}{I will not trade with outsiders until war is over. This is what high Chief Geronimo decides.}
{242}{}{Okay, I'll do without your leathers.}
{243}{}{The war is over. You can trade again, my friend.}
{244}{}{Perhaps chief is too busy to tell me about this. Okay, look what I have. Maybe you need something custom-made?}
{245}{}{Thanks, give me time to think.}
{246}{}{Come on, we're neighbors, not strangers.}
{247}{}{Sorry, but my chief knows best.}
{248}{}{Are you sure? I see.}
{249}{}{Neighbors should live in peace. Your tribe and my Villa should trade in peace.}
{250}{}{I agree with you, stranger. Chief Geronimo spoke only about Phoenix and its colonies. Villa is not one of them. So, look what I have. Maybe you need something custom-made?}
{251}{}{Thanks, give me time to think.}
{252}{}{Aren't I trustworthy, Ronnie?}
{253}{}{Sorry, I did not mean to attack you with my words. You are not one of those who deceived and harmed our tribe. Here, look at my goods. Maybe you need something custom-made?}
{254}{}{Thanks, let me think about it.}

{260}{}{Greetings, hero. All of tribe is grateful to you for your deeds. Here, take this weapon as sign of my gratitude. The shamans endowed it with power of the Divine Brahmin.}
{1260}{}{Greetings, heroine. All of tribe is grateful to you for your deeds. Here, take this weapon as sign of my gratitude. The shamans endowed it with power of the Divine Brahmin.}
{261}{}{Hmm. Interesting weapon.}
{262}{}{Though the power of this weapon is not unlimited. When the divine energy runs out, you need to replace... er... bat-ter ease...}
{263}{}{Thanks, Ronnie.}

{270}{}{The war is over, thanks to your help. San Brahmin reopens trade routes to Phoenix. So, I can again open doors of my workshop to all.}
{271}{}{The war is over, thanks to your help. San Brahmin no longer trusts the Phoenix Empire and its colonies. But we are still open to our friends and Rangers.}
{272}{}{[More]}
{273}{}{If you need any leather goods, speak with me.}
{274}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}

{280}{}{Hmm. You match the description of bandit who attacked our herders near Garage City.}
{281}{}{I don't know what you're talking about. I had nothing to do with that.}
{282}{}{Ha! Even children who have peed themselves say that their feet are dry. Leave in peace.}
{283}{}{Okay...}
{284}{}{Yes, but it was a misunderstanding. We thought it was a wild brahmin.}
{285}{}{Should have thought more before acting. You are lucky that the herders were not hurt. If they were, whole pueblo would be angry with you. But it is good that you admit your mistake. Now I know to be careful around you.}
{286}{}{Uh, okay...}
{287}{}{I'll think about your words, wise man.}
{288}{}{Leave your moralizing to the stupid kids, dumbass.}

{290}{}{You know, Mangas asked me to destroy the firewater production in Phoenix.}
{291}{}{Who does he think he is? The shaman cannot deprive us all of our joys so easily. Nobody will like this. At least Mangas cannot decide for all clans at once; he is not high Chief.}
{292}{}{So you're against Mangas' idea?}
{293}{}{This is everyone's business, not just the elder's. We should not follow whims of this grumpy old man. It is better for me to get case of Phoenix firewater. I would find a use for it at celebration of Day of the Sun.}
{294}{}{But what's the problem with getting alcohol?}
{295}{}{Do you not know? We stopped all trade with Phoenix because of war. We also know how to make firewater from cacti. But real firewater, 'tequila' from the city, is much better.}
{296}{}{How many bottles do you need?}
{297}{}{Hmm...ten bottles of fir...tequila and the same number of bottles of beer.}
{298}{}{Okay, I'll think about which of you to support in this debate.}
{299}{}{Remind me how many bottles of alcohol you need?}
{300}{}{I have just the right amount of alcohol for you.}
{301}{}{May your name be praised by Sun-faced Brahmin himself! With such supplies, our holiday will not be overshadowed even by war going on around us. Thank you. If you need leather work, then remember me. I will make anything for you, at lower price.}
{302}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Bye, Ronnie.}

{310}{}{What are you trading? }
{311}{}{I make many items from brahmin leather. But they are mostly used by my fellow tribesmen. I no longer do business with Phoenix and its colonies. Rangers are free to make orders with me.}
{312}{}{I see.}
{313}{}{What items do you make?}
{314}{}{Clothes, belts, bags and more. I make armor for rangers.}
{315}{}{What's the problem with Phoenix?}
{316}{}{We lived in peace for a time. But in the last few years, pale-face men have come from the big city with guns to control us or take from us what belongs to us. The tribe will not bear this.}
{317}{}{So you have good relations with the Rangers?}
{318}{}{They help us resist the Phoenix invaders. And they have always been good customers at my workshop.}
{319}{}{Who do you support in this dispute?}
{320}{}{It is hard to speak with wisdom. The Rangers have treated us well so far, but I think maybe they are not pure in their intentions. They have their own interests in this conflict.}
{321}{}{[More]}
{322}{}{But, we lived in peace with Phoenix for long time and traded with them until things went sour. Phoenix would have traded with us more if there was not greedy tyrant in charge.}
{323}{}{I see.}
