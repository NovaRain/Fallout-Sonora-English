{100}{}{You see Eugene.}
{101}{}{You see a teenager. His hands are stained with dirt and rust, clearly he enjoys tinkering with equipment.}
{102}{}{You wanted a better life, boy? This is the best I can offer.}
{103}{}{Sorry, kid, but in this life, only pain and suffering awaited you.}
{104}{}{Eugene has reached his destination.}
{105}{}{Wow!}
{106}{}{As long as Eugene is on your team, you receive a 20-point bonus to repairing broken equipment.}

{120}{}{ }
{121}{}{Wow! I've never seen anything like it!}
{122}{}{Is this a real working radio station? That's wild!}
{123}{}{ }
{124}{}{Let's get out of here, this place scares me.}
{125}{}{You're lucky to have a house like this. I have to live in a hut made of trash.}
{126}{}{I heard about this city, but I never expected to be here!}
{127}{}{I don't know why, but I don't like this place.}
{128}{}{This doesn't look like a ranger base. Are we going the right way?}
{129}{}{What are all these people doing?}
{130}{}{What... what happened here?!}

#Final dialogue
{190}{}{Thanks for everything. These Rangers are tough guys, and their dam is a real fortress. I'm so happy!}
{191}{}{It's good that you like it here. Have fun.}
{192}{}{Pull up your pants, kid. You still have a lot to learn.}
{193}{}{Hello again.}
{194}{}{See ya, kid.}

{195}{}{A lot of bad things are said about you in the wastelands. Are they true?}
{196}{}{Honestly, you're just a means to an end for me. No more.}
{197}{}{That's just gossip spread by my enemies. Ignore it.}
{198}{}{I thought so...}
{199}{}{Hmph.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{Who are you? Hey, you're not from around here!}
{201}{}{Uh, yeah.}
{202}{}{Then where are you from? Are you enslaving peasants too?}
{203}{}{Actually... YES!}
{204}{}{Get away from me!}
{205}{}{Hey, don't be such a wuss... I'll spare this shithole.}
{206}{}{On the contrary, I'm going to free them. What do you know about the attack on Villa?}
{207}{}{Nothing. Better leave before the others give you a "warm" welcome.}
{208}{}{What do you mean by that?}
{209}{}{Okay, okay, I don't think I'll be staying here long.}
{210}{}{Well, this place is getting pretty bad. There won't be anything left in the ruins soon. Then the cartel will fall apart, and all that'll be left for the residents is a life of banditry. I wish I could just get out of this hellhole!}
{211}{}{Where would you go if you could?}
{212}{}{To the Rangers. Or just head south, where there's at least some kind of civilization.}
{213}{}{You have ambitious plans. Adios, muchacho.}
{214}{}{What do you know about the raid on Villa?}
{215}{}{Hi.}
{216}{}{See ya, kid.}
{217}{}{My dad doesn't like people just walking into our house.}

#In a team
{220}{}{What are we doing here?}
{221}{}{When are we going to get to the Rangers?}
{222}{}{Are we there yet?}
{223}{}{I'm tired...}
{224}{}{Let's take a break, okay?}
{225}{}{I can't wait to see the Ranger Dam.}
{226}{}{Do you know exactly where to go?}
{227}{}{It must be nice to travel with Rangers.}
{228}{}{Is it true that Rangers drink their own urine while traveling?}
{229}{}{I wish I could see the Ranger General himself!}

{230}{}{Wait here, I'll be back soon.}
{231}{}{Let's go.}
{232}{}{Put that down.}
{233}{}{But you'll protect me, right?}
{234}{}{Take it off.}
{235}{}{Whatever you say.}
{236}{}{I just wanna get home as quick as I can... Though... I don't know what I really want anymore.}
{237}{}{I don't like those other guys. Are they coming with us too? Then I'm not going.}
{238}{}{Not a good idea, kid.}
{239}{}{Eugene doesn't trust your crew. He'll only go with you.}

#Joining the team
{300}{}{Hey kid, the Rangers are interested in your skills. I'm here to take you to the base.}
{301}{}{What?! Really?! Amazing! Yes, I dreamed about this ever since I first saw a Ranger. But...}
{302}{}{But?}
{303}{}{Dad won't let me go. He doesn't even want to hear about the Rangers and thinks I should be a scavenger like him. But I'm not interested in digging through scrap metal, patching up junk. I want to work on real machines!}
{304}{}{Exactly. Your talents will never flourish here. You belong with the Rangers.}
{305}{}{I can't just run away. And if I do, the locals will blame the Rangers, and turn against them. They already treat them with contempt. Can you talk to my dad? Maybe he'll listen to you?}
{306}{}{Okay, I'll talk to him.}
{307}{}{The Rangers are still interested in you.}
{308}{}{That's great... But I can't leave until my dad agrees.}
{309}{}{Okay, I'll talk to him.}
{310}{}{Your father has agreed. You're free to go.}
{311}{}{Really?! I didn't even hope. I thought he would never allow it... So when do we leave?}
{312}{}{Right now. Let's go.}
{313}{}{Your father is dead. Now you're free.}
{314}{}{How?! But... I didn't think it would turn out like this. (sobs) Whatever he was, he only wanted the best for me... (calms down) Well, now I definitely have nothing to lose. When do we leave?}
{315}{}{Right now. Let's go.}
{316}{}{How about a sneaky dose of scorpion venom?}
{317}{}{You're not serious, are you? I'd never forgive you!}
{318}{}{Want to just run away?}
{319}{}{Then the Rangers here will be treated even worse than they are now. And I won't get far on my own.}

#If the dam is broken
{320}{}{I've got some bad news: the Ranger base has been destroyed.}
{321}{}{It can't be! I was so hoping that everything would work out... that I wouldn't have to dig through trash anymore for a couple of caps... But I don't want to go back home either. What should I do?}
{322}{}{You won't survive alone in the desert, and what's left of the Rangers have no time for you right now. Go back home.}
{323}{}{Now no one will pay me to guard your ass. You're on your own kid. Disappear.}
{324}{}{Dad warned me not to trust you. I'll find my own way home!}
{325}{}{Off you go then.}
{326}{}{Yah, I guess... I can't believe it was all for nothing!}
{327}{}{Well, maybe life in a junkyard won't be so bad. Let's go.}
{328}{}{Here you are at home. What's the matter?}
{329}{}{You know... This journey with you wasn't in vain. I saw so much, discovered a whole world I knew nothing about. After all this, I won't be able to live as before. Someday, I'm definitely gonna travel south.}
{330}{}{Well, that's good to hear, but a little bittersweet. Good luck kid.}
{331}{}{Now you can decide for yourself. My job is done. Take care kid.}
