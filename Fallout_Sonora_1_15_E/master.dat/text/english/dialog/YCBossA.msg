{100}{}{You see Senor Gustavo.}
{101}{}{You see Senor Gustavo, the mayor of San Ysidro.}
{102}{}{Here, I am the law!}
{103}{}{Ghouls need radio comms? Let's help them out - then maybe Gomer will get some respect.}
{104}{}{Meet me at the pier.}

# First Meeting
{200}{}{Gustavo Obanel Vallejo at your service. I'm the mayor of San Ysidro. Now, to hell with the niceties. I want to know why you disrupted our peace and quiet.}
{1200}{}{Gustavo Obanel Vallejo at your service. I'm the mayor of San Ysidro. Now, to hell with the niceties. I want to know why you disrupted our peace and quiet.}
# Gustavo Obanel Vallejo at your service. I'm the mayor of San Ysidro. Now, to hell with pleasantries. I want to know the reason why you're disturbing our posthumous peace. We don't tolerate smoothskins here. Our family has suffered enough from you. Therefore, explain clearly and without lying - why should we tolerate your presence?
{201}{}{I'm not here to disturb your peace and quiet. I'm here for profit. Heard there's good money to be made here.}
{202}{}{An honest answer. I'm starting to like you already. You might be someone I can deal with.}
{203}{}{Depends on the deal, friend.}
{204}{}{Actually, I'm looking for a better place to call home. Things are pretty bad back where I come from.}
{205}{}{Running from your problems, huh? Not impressive, smoothskin. But you might still be useful.}
{1205}{}{Running from your problems, huh? Not impressive, smoothskin. But you might still be useful.}
{206}{}{Hmph. Maybe. What kind of work is available around here?}
{207}{}{I've got no problem with you. I'm fine with ghouls and wouldn't mind living among them.}
{1207}{}{I've got no problem with you. I'm fine with ghouls and wouldn't mind living among them.}
{208}{}{Your skin is so smooth, you could be dessert, normie. I won't stand for any more lies. But I'll give you one chance. Prove yourself, and you'll get your ghoul hugs for the rest of your days.}
{209}{}{Hey, I was just trying to be friendly. How can I prove myself?}
{1209}{}{Hey, I was just trying to be friendly. How can I prove myself?}
{210}{}{Gustavo Obanel Vallejo at your service. I'm the mayor of San Ysidro. Glad to see you in our camp, brother. You'll find eternal rest here.}
{1210}{}{Gustavo Obanel Vallejo at your service. I'm the mayor of San Ysidro. Glad to see you in our camp, sister. You'll find eternal rest here.}
{211}{}{Thanks, brother. So what can I do for work in this fine city?}
{212}{}{Dayglow can't shine like it should. We've got no power. If you're lookin' for work, head to the power station and help our crew get the lights back on. Do that, and I'll reward you well - you'll have a place in San Ysidro as long as you like.}
{213}{}{Dayglow can't shine like it should. We're still without power. If you're lookin' for work, head to the power station and help our folks restore the lights. Do it, and all of Dayglow will remember you till the end of days.}
{214}{}{You've got a deal.}
{215}{}{That sounds like too much hassle to me.}
{216}{}{Wrong choice of words, normie. Get back to the nuclear wasteland! We don't need you here.}
{217}{}{Oh-oh...}
{218}{}{After the incident at the border, this conversation will be brief. What do you want?}
{219}{}{What incident? I don't know what you're talking about!}
{220}{}{My loyal guards were protecting the entrance. Now only the wind roams there. And here you are. What do you have to say for yourself?}
{221}{}{It's just a coincidence. The entrance was open, so I walked in.}
{1221}{}{It's just a coincidence. The entrance was open, so I walked in.}
{222}{}{Hmm, if I find out you're lying, I'll personally peel your smooth skin and sprinkle your raw flesh with radioactive ash. You'll feel all the pain ghouls experience every day.}
{223}{}{I believe every word. But who are you?}
{224}{}{That ghoul threatened me. I was just defending myself.}
{1224}{}{That ghoul threatened me. I was just defending myself.}
{225}{}{He was a loyal servant of Dayglow. He protected our city from normies. Think you can atone for your crime?}
{226}{}{You can't just set borders wherever you want, especially if you can't defend them.}
{227}{}{We just want to live like normal people. No wars. No grand missions to save humanity. Maybe you can't understand that. But since you're here, in our territory, you have little choice - atone or... die.}
{228}{}{I choose death. Yours!}
{229}{}{Can't we negotiate? By the way, we haven't introduced ourselves.}
{230}{}{I don't remember being warned about your arrival. How did you get past the border?}
{231}{}{Well, I just walked through the gate.}
{232}{}{And the loyal servants of Dayglow didn't stop you? Someone's getting a good beating.}
{233}{}{Definitely not me. Anyway... So you're in charge here?}
{234}{}{(frowns) To live here, you'll have to some kind of work. Even a mutant like you should understand that. We've got enough freeloaders already.}
{235}{}{Alright...}
{236}{}{Any ideas on how to fix the radio station?}

# Repeat Dialogue
{250}{}{Speak, smoothskin.}
{1250}{}{Speak, smoothskin.}
{251}{}{Goodbye, Senor Gustavo.}
{252}{}{What are you up to, normie?}
{1252}{}{What are you up to, smoothskin?}
{253}{}{Look who we have here. Smoothskin looking for a beating. Don't worry, I'll save your skin for grafting onto my old body. But first, you're going to tell me everything.}
{254}{}{Sit down, amigo. I hope the ghouls in Dayglow have been treating you like one of their own.}
{255}{}{Sit down, amigo. How's Dayglow treating you? Everything alright? Let me know if there are any problems.}
{256}{}{Sit down, amigo. Talk to me. Maybe I can help.}
{1254}{}{Sit down, amiga. I hope the ghouls in Dayglow have been treating you like one of their own.}
{1255}{}{Sit down, amiga. How's Dayglow treating you? Everything alright? Let me know if there are any problems.}
{1256}{}{Sit down, amiga. Talk to me. Maybe I can help.}
{257}{}{Sit down. I think it's high time we had a talk.}

{260}{}{Remind me what you wanted from me?}
{261}{}{Am I speaking Russian? (tired sigh) }
{262}{}{The power station is working.}
{263}{}{Dayglow shines again! The lights are back on in San Ysidro and Old Town. You've done a great deed, amigo. Let me hug you and thanks. Here's 1000 caps.}
{1263}{}{Dayglow shines again! The lights are back on in San Ysidro and Old Town. You've done a great deed, amiga. Let me hug you and thank you. Here's 1000 caps.}
{264}{}{Thanks.}
{265}{}{Not bad.}
{266}{}{I owe you an apology. I gave you this task thinking you'd likely be killed by robots or radiation. At the least, turned tail and run. And there'd be one less smoothskin in Dayglow. But I was wrong. You actually did it. You can stay in our city as long as you want, amigo.}
{1266}{}{I owe you an apology. I gave you this task thinking you'd likely be killed by robots or radiation. At the least, turned tail and run. And there'd be one less smoothskin in Dayglow. But I was wrong. You actually did it. You can stay in our city as long as you want, amiga.}
{267}{}{I understand and don't blame you.}
{268}{}{Hmph. Don't expect me to shake your hand after that.}
{1268}{}{Hmph. Don't expect me to hug you after that.}
{269}{}{Now that we have electricity, we need to fix the broken radio station. It's in the next room. It seems like this task is just right for you.}
{270}{}{How broken is it? Are you sure it can be fixed?}
{271}{}{Fixed - no. It pretty much needs a total replacement. I know there's an identical one at the border patrol center. I'll pay if you bring the parts from there.}
{272}{}{Alright. I'll try.}
{273}{}{I might look into it when I'm in the mood. But for now, I don't feel like it. See you.}
{274}{}{The radio station is working again. Actually, I had to replace it with the one from the border office.}
{275}{}{That's another piece of great news in this scorched world! And I like you more and more, smoothskin. You're just like I was in my youth.}
{1275}{}{That's another piece of great news in this scorched world! And I like you more and more, smoothskin. You're just like I was in my youth.}
{276}{}{That's another great piece of news in this scorched world!}
{277}{}{Not the nicest comparison, you know.}
{278}{}{Let's skip the hugs, okay?}
{279}{}{Now, let's get back to business. First, here's 500 caps for fixing the radio. Again, thanks. Next, I need you to take this holodisk to Mayor Butler in Old Town. It's very important. I think I can trust you to get this job done.}
{280}{}{That's it? After the last couple of tasks, this will be a walk in the park.}
{281}{}{The route that lies before you winds through the grim ruins of San Diego. Don't underestimate it. Many dangers lurk there. Be more careful. I really need this holodisk to get through. And ask Edward for supplies for the trip.}
{282}{}{Alright, see you.}
{283}{}{Give me a weapon if you want me to survive the trip to Old Town.}
{1283}{}{Give me a weapon if you want me to survive the trip to Old Town.}
{284}{}{Hmm, alright. What weapon are you best with?}
{285}{}{[Take }
{286}{}{]}
{287}{}{Be so kind as not to die on the way.}
{1287}{}{Be so kind as not to die on the way.}
{288}{}{I'll try...}
{289}{}{I'll try to answer them.}
{290}{}{Is it that important to you?}
{291}{}{We need this radio station. Dayglow's areas are torn apart by impassable ruins, and radiation blocks regular weak radios. Constant communication will change the entire city. Do your best for all of us.}
{292}{}{What's on this disk?}
{293}{}{First, data for radio broadcasts so we can communicate over distances. And second... Second, some warnings for my brother to keep him from making big mistakes.}


{296}{}{How do I get to the power station?}
{297}{}{There are two ways. You can go straight on Federal Highway 805, then turn east at the sign. But the highway is patrolled by military robots. The less dangerous path lies through the toxic swamps in Chula Vista.}
{298}{}{Alright, I'll try to find it.}

#Inquiries
{300}{}{Can I ask a few questions?}
{301}{}{Amigo, I'm always happy to listen and answer your questions. But there are more important things to do now. You know what to do.}
{1301}{}{Amiga, I'm always happy to listen and answer your questions. But there are more important things to do now. You know what to do.}
{302}{}{It would be better if you got to work. You know what I mean.}
{303}{}{Now what. I'm not even sure I should be talking to you.}
{304}{}{Got it. We'll talk later.}
{305}{}{If you don't wanna talk, fine. Goodbye.}
{306}{}{Amigo, I'm always happy to listen and answer your questions.}
{1306}{}{Amiga, I'm always happy to listen and answer your questions.}
{307}{}{Alright, see you.}

{310}{}{Can you tell me more about yourself?}
{311}{}{You want to know about me? Strange question. I was once a doctor. But the War nullified my license. Now, as you see, I run a small town. You can learn anything if life forces you to.}
{312}{}{By the way, about this town. I don't understand, where is Dayglow then? What is it?}
{313}{}{It's in our heart. Dayglow is the ghouls' dream. A dream of a city where we can peacefully grow old. And San Ysidro is one of its districts. Here we are protected by the old border wall.}
{314}{}{So your goal is to build Dayglow?}
{315}{}{A city for ghouls is my goal. We just want to live like normal people. Without oppression. Without wars. Without grand missions to save humanity.}
{316}{}{Got it. I had some other questions...}
{317}{}{Is Old Town also striving for this paradise?}
{318}{}{It doesn't seem like Old Town shares your dream.}
{319}{}{Old Town is making a mistake. It's too close to the caravan trail and therefore can't avoid the corrupting influence of smoothskins from the northern cities.}
{320}{}{How do I get to Old Town?}
{321}{}{Go north. You can go straight through the piers, basically a radioactive hell. Or you can go around through the suburban ruins, ensuring yourself new and not always welcome encounters.}
{322}{}{Got it.}
{323}{}{What is Dayglow? Where is it located?}
{324}{}{What kind of city are you trying to build?}
{325}{}{It will be a city as it was a hundred years ago. We collect everything that is left from the Old World. Here, no one cares about us, so we can relax and peacefully live out our days.}
{326}{}{Tell me about yourself.}

{350}{}{I gave the holodisk to Butler. Your message didn't convince him.}
{1350}{}{I gave the holodisk to Butler. Your message didn't convince him.}
{351}{}{No surprise there. John and I argue about Dayglow all the time - about what our city should be. He's too focused on smoothskins and seems to have forgotten that we're people of the Old World. We can revive the city, rebuild it from the ground up! Sure, ghouls are weak, but we've got old machines and energy left over. With the right tech, we could make life here work, even in these scorched ruins.}
{352}{}{By the way, after reading the holodisk, he asked me to help him get chips from the aircraft factory.}
{353}{}{What an idiot! That factory can still work for us ghouls. Don't hand the chips over to Old Town - give them to me. Our techie can use them to repair the robots, and with their help, we'll rebuild the city. That'll give us a better future than just trading food with caravanners.}
{354}{}{I'll think about it.}
{355}{}{Alright. I'll do it.}
{356}{}{I knew you'd say that, so I brought the chips with me in just in case. Here they are.}
{1356}{}{I knew you'd say that, so I brought the chips with me in just in case. Here they are.}
{357}{}{Thanks. Here's 1000 caps for the job. The factory will work for us too - we can't let it get destroyed. I think you should personally tell John that the factory's under my control now, and I'm keeping the chips.}
{358}{}{Alright.}
{359}{}{Here's the chips that Butler wanted to sell. He won't be able to now.}
{360}{}{Then I have bad news for you - Butler already took the chips and is getting ready to sell them.}
{361}{}{That's really bad news. I think you should keep an eye on Butler. Let me know if you find out what he's planning next.}
{362}{}{Alright.}
{363}{}{I have bad news for you - Butler already took the chips and is getting ready to sell them.}
{364}{}{Good, and also - keep me informed about what Butler is planning if you find out.}
{365}{}{Got it.}

{370}{}{Butler is planning to take control of the naval base on the island...}
{371}{}{He's making a huge mistake! He'll sell most of the finds to smoothskins, and it'll shake up all the human settlements. The war with the super mutants just died down, and now fights over old tech will flare up again. Smoothskins don't understand how to handle the Old World's legacy - and they could turn it against us. Technology should stay with the ghouls; we need it more, and we know better how to use it.}
{372}{}{What are you going to do?}
{373}{}{Butler won't back down. We've got to land first and take control for ourselves. Then we can dictate things. I'll send a team to the pier to handle this. And you use the radio station as he asked, then head to the pier.}
{374}{}{Okay.}
