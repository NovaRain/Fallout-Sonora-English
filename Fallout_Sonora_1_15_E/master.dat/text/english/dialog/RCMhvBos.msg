{100}{}{You see a bandit.}
{101}{}{You see a man who resembles a Ranger, but something's off.}
{102}{}{Get lost before I decide to use this gun.}

#First Dialogue
{200}{}{Hold up. You're in Ranger territory. What's your business here?}
{201}{}{What's with the hassle? The wasteland belongs to no one. Only crooks lay claim to what's open to all.}
{202}{}{Interesting perspective. But it's irrelevant. I asked what brings you here.}
{203}{}{Maybe I'm looking for you. Heard you've been robbing travelers, posing as a Ranger.}
{204}{}{I am a Ranger, got the badge right here. And I'm not stealing. Just collecting dues for crossing borders. It's how I make a living. You'll be paying up too, by the way.}
{205}{}{This your turf? Prove it.}
{206}{}{You're just another raider scum, aren't you?}
{210}{}{Heat got your brain scrambled? You ain't calling the shots here. Hand over your goods, and you're free to go.}
{211}{}{Fine, fine, take everything. Just don't hurt me.}
{212}{}{Scram so I don't have to see you around here again.}
{213}{}{Whatever you say...}
{214}{}{Hey, give me back my stuff! Right now.}
{215}{}{Not happening.}
{216}{}{Your fault then. Boys, you know what to do...}
{217}{}{Who's the first to die?}
{218}{}{Alright, alright, I'll hand it over. Here, take it...}
{219}{}{These things are awfully radioactive, by the way. You want to risk your health for that?}
{220}{}{Not buying your tricks. Last warning or things will get ugly.}
{221}{}{Fine. Just be careful with those things. They're awfully radioactive.}
{222}{}{What?! Put that shit away, you idiot! Why would you even carry that stuff with you?}
{1222}{}{What?! Put that shit away, you dumb bitch! Why would you even carry that stuff with you?}
{223}{}{For situations like this.}
{224}{}{I need it for a job.}
{225}{}{No. First, I want to know who you REALLY are. A Ranger wouldn't upend Law and Order like this.}
{226}{}{You're not a Ranger. A true Ranger wouldn't extort money like a common raider.}
{230}{}{I AM the law. I hold the power here, and who are you to question me? Do as I say!}
{231}{}{To hell with that...}
{232}{}{If you're a Ranger, you're not worthy of your badge. I strip you of your rank. Give me the badge.}
{233}{}{A Ranger who has broken the law is stripped of their rank. Give me the badge.}
{240}{}{Law and Order. Empty words. Rangers come in, claim territory, and squeeze folks dry. How's what I'm doin' any different? If they steal, so will we.}
{241}{}{People get protection in exchange. And there's always another place to go.}
{242}{}{So Rangers don't protect their lands?}
{243}{}{People are just pawns to them. Understand? No one's got each other's backs. Rangers promised defense from raiders. But where were they when my town was raided?}
{244}{}{Maybe they were occupied elsewhere?}
{245}{}{Supposed to make me feel better? For two years, they taxed us to the bone. We starved, they didn't care. And of course, they took the best weapons for themselves. Ones that might have kept those raiders at bay if we'd had them.}
{246}{}{Sad story. Must have made you real bitter.}
{247}{}{No shit. And don't think I'll just let you off. Give me all your stuff. And your clothes.}
{248}{}{I'm not part of this. Leave me alone.}
{249}{}{The crimes of others are no excuse. Give me your badge and I might let you live.}
{250}{}{What happened is terrible. But you should let it go, move on.}
{251}{}{You think I'm a fool? Hand over everything, slowly so I can see it all.}
{252}{}{Come on. I understand you. My own village was raided by slavers.}
{253}{}{I think I heard something about that. So we're both victims.}
{254}{}{Exactly. And you're gonna be *my* next victim. Say your last words, loser...}
{255}{}{That's right - don't go after any more civilians. They're innocent, like us. You're targeting the wrong people.}
{256}{}{I KNOW. But what can we do? We survive outside the *law*, we have nowhere to go.}
{257}{}{How about hunting animals or protecting caravans? You can always find a way.}
{258}{}{To hell with this conversation. You can't change a scumbag's mind...}
{259}{}{My gang and I've been talking this over. We're tired of living like this. There aren't many people in these wastes, and the risks just keep getting bigger. It's time for a change. The badge? Yeah, sure, take it. It's worthless to me anyway.}
{260}{}{You're making a wise decision. Well done.}
{261}{}{Yeah, yeah. Scram before I change my mind.}
{262}{}{Alright, alright, I'm going...}
{300}{}{Back again? You still don't get it?}
{301}{}{There's nothing to "get" here. You're just another common raider. Rangers are law-abiding, and you're not.}
{302}{}{You don't call the shots here. This land isn't yours to dictate where folks go.}
{303}{}{You really a Ranger, or just playin' 'Law and Order'?}
