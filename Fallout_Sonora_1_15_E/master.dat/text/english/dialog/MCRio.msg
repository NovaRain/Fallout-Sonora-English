{100}{}{You see Rio.}
{101}{}{You see one of the Blue Shields.}
{102}{}{Well, well, looks like we've got a mole rat here.}

#Having received the title Road Warrior
{200}{}{(grinds his teeth, looking you straight in the eyes like an animal) So, I have to make room now? It's getting a little crowded around Ben, huh?}
{201}{}{Yes, Ben and I are on great terms now...}
{202}{}{Then remember, *I* am still next in line after Ben. Don't dare cross my path.}
{203}{}{Okay.}
{204}{}{}
{205}{}{(grinning on one side) Look who we have here. Ben's new favorite.}
{206}{}{Jealous, huh? Afraid you'll have to move over?}
{207}{}{Listen up, bitch, NO ONE will take my place next to Ben. We've been through thick and thin, he trusts me. And you? Nobody here knows you mother fucker.}
{208}{}{Relax, Rio, I'm not looking to take your spot.}
{209}{}{CORRECT answer, bitch. Know your place. Ben and I have history, he trusts me. And who are you? Just another fuckin' face.}
{210}{}{You should wash your mouth with soap.}
{211}{}{Ah, so Ben's favor does give you a sense of superiority. You better not cross my path, you piece of carrion.}
{212}{}{Okay.}
{213}{}{Easy there, buddy. I'm in the gang too.}
{214}{}{Exactly. Don't cross my path.}
{215}{}{Okay.}

#Acquaintance
{220}{}{Why the hell are you walking around here, roadkill?}
{221}{}{Just looking around. And who are you?}
{222}{}{I'd like to meet you. I'm new here.}
{223}{}{Let's meet, huh? MEET ME, bitch? Do I look like a prostitute to you? You'll meet corpses in the wasteland, we're a gang. They don't like soft-bodied brats here. Got it?}
{224}{}{Your manners are crap, bro.}
{225}{}{Yeah, that's right, bro. I see you're starting to learn. Maybe we can work together someday.}
{226}{}{Great, first contact made.}
{227}{}{Not a good start.}
{228}{}{Shove your manners up your ass and dance a jig on the hot pavement, bitch.}
{229}{}{Whoa, lighten up. I just wanted to talk.}
{230}{}{I'm looking for someone to do business with in this hole. Looks like you might be one of them.}
{231}{}{Okay, I see you're no push-over. Consider the first contact a success. But don't expect trust just because Ben lets you wander around the base. Prove yourself in action, then we'll talk.}
{232}{}{Okay. And who are you?}
{233}{}{Name's Rio, baby. And that's all you need to know until you prove yourself.}
{234}{}{I have a couple of questions for you.}
{235}{}{Oh well.}

#Re-dialogue
{250}{}{What do you need?}
{251}{}{What do you want, carrion?}
{252}{}{How're you doing?}
{253}{}{Bye, Rio.}

{260}{}{I'm wondering how someone like you ended up in a gang.}
{261}{}{There were some... incidents. I wandered the roads with different gangs until I ended up here.}
{262}{}{What, kicked out of all the normal cities?}
{263}{}{What are you hinting at, bitch? Do you think the gang just appeared out of nowhere? We're all victims of circumstances, understand that.}
{264}{}{Yeah, sure, that sounds better.}
{265}{}{What have you done?}
{266}{}{Is it really that bad in cities?}
{267}{}{The gang didn't just appear. We're all victims of circumstances, don't you think?}
{268}{}{I understand. I was forced to leave my home too.}
{269}{}{Exactly. Everyone here was driven away from their homes.}
{270}{}{Everyone here seems to blame external circumstances for their problems.}
{271}{}{What made you join?}
{272}{}{I was on the wrong team in Phoenix when Aaron took over. Had to flee to Casa Grande.}
{273}{}{Didn't please the local authorities there either?}
{274}{}{What happened in Casa Grande?}
{275}{}{Aaron is a real tyrant. You did the right thing running from that hellhole.}
{276}{}{The water pump in Casa Grande got fixed. Clan wars erupted over it. Guess whose team lost this time.}
{277}{}{Born loser, huh?}
{278}{}{No luck again?}
{279}{}{I hope the other guys get what they have coming.}
{280}{}{But Ben's gang is different. Everyone here belongs, everyone gets what they earn... But why am I telling you this? Your chatter is boring me. Get lost, I need to work on my gear.}
{281}{}{Not until I learn more.}
{282}{}{With pleasure. Bye.}

{290}{}{What do you do in the gang?}
{291}{}{I'm second in command of the Blue Shields. After Ben, of course. When he's gone, I run things - keep order, distribute rations, train the young ones, and make lazy sons of bitches work. }
{292}{}{[More]}
{293}{}{And when Ben comes back, I make sure he feels at home - dope, girls, wheels.}
{294}{}{I see.}
{295}{}{What can you teach?}
{296}{}{Training? Interesting. Tell me more.}
{297}{}{We need to stay in shape. I teach weapon handling, combat skills, and rites of passage. Handling molotov cocktails and melee weapons is especially valuable to us.}
{298}{}{I'd love to learn how to throw molotov cocktails.}
{299}{}{Not interested.}
{300}{}{Teach you? I don't like you, plain and simple.}
{301}{}{Okay, we'll get to that later.}
{302}{}{Imagine that, the feeling's mutual.}
{303}{}{You're new here. If you want training, bring me something valuable.}
{304}{}{Okay. But you'll have to wait.}
{305}{}{I thought gang relationships would be different.}
{306}{}{But I'm already in the gang. Why not?}
{307}{}{Either pay up or get lost.}
{308}{}{Okay...}
{309}{}{Come on, bro. Am I not worthy of respect?}
{310}{}{Damn, you're twisting my balls. Fine, get ready for a fight. I'm feeling generous today.}
{311}{}{Okay, let's start the fun...}
{312}{}{Not now, I need to do something first.}
{313}{}{I have 250 caps. Is that enough?}
{314}{}{Quite enough. Go get ready for a fight.}
{315}{}{Okay, let's start the fun...}
{316}{}{Can you teach me how to fight with knives?}

{320}{}{About that motorcycle.}
{321}{}{For Ben, it's not just a toy; it's part of his life. I make sure he's got everything he needs - fixing the bike, finding dope, getting women - whatever Ben wants.}
{322}{}{Cool. Good to know.}
{323}{}{Wow, you got it to run?}
{324}{}{Of course. Who do you think I am? If Ben says to keep an eye on his bike, then the bike is taken care of.}
{325}{}{Is it for sale?}
{326}{}{You're delusional. Ben values his wheels more than anyone in the gang. He won't give it up for anything.}
{327}{}{Ben lent me his motorcycle. Give me the keys.}
{328}{}{What the fuck is this, bitch? I take care of Ben's motorcycle like it's my own dick. And now you come and want to take it? What kind of crap are you feeding him to make him so generous?}
{329}{}{Sorry, I don't want to fight. Of course, keep the keys. It's okay, bro.}
{330}{}{Great, let's settle this right here and now.}
{331}{}{Fuck yeah. Now you're gonna dance for me bitch.}
{332}{}{. . .}
{333}{}{Shut up and give me the keys.}
{334}{}{Oh, now you've done it. I oughta mess you up real good, you little bitch!}
{335}{}{I understand how you feel. Let me pay 250 caps as compensation.}
{336}{}{You want to bribe me? ME? I'll take these caps. But when the right moment comes, I'll shove them down your throat and make you shoot the tires with your ass. Bitch, you'll remember this day.}
{337}{}{Maybe. Now give me the keys.}
{338}{}{Shut your mouth and hand over the keys.}
{339}{}{Calm down, Rio. Ben is still loyal to you. And me too.}

{340}{}{Ben lent me his motorcycle. Give me the keys.}
{341}{}{Mother fuck... I've killed people for less. Do you know why?}
{342}{}{I don't really...}
{343}{}{Why?}
{344}{}{I take care of Ben's motorcycle like it's my own dick. I keep it spotless to please him. Do you think I like that Ben treats my work this way?}
{345}{}{Hold on...}
{346}{}{Damn it, why is he doing this to me? For what! I've been loyal, fulfilled his every whim, and he just hands you the bike. I can't believe this.}
{347}{}{Rio, don't be so jealous. He just lent me the bike, that's all.}
{348}{}{Jealous? Ha! You're a soft-bodied snake, I see what you're worth.}
{349}{}{Give me the keys.}
{350}{}{Shut your mouth and hand over the keys.}
{351}{}{It's time to realize, Rio, you're not alone in the gang. Sometimes you have to share.}
{352}{}{It's all because of you! You're like a snake sneaking into bed. Everything was fine between me and Ben until you showed up.}
{353}{}{You'd better discuss this with Ben. Now give me the keys.}
{354}{}{Shut your mouth and hand over the keys.}
{355}{}{Here's the keys. I hope you crash in a ditch.}
{356}{}{Relax, dude.}
{357}{}{You can't intimidate me.}

#Dope delivery
{400}{}{You mentioned doing business in Phoenix. Maybe I can help?}
{401}{}{Maybe. But why do you care?}
{402}{}{I want to be useful to the gang. }
{403}{}{Well, well. You want to be ahead of everyone? You're a cunning son of a bitch.}
{1403}{}{Well, well. You want to be ahead of everyone? You're one sly bitch.}
{404}{}{I want to change your shitty attitude towards me.}
{405}{}{Right idea. My respect must be EARNED.}
{406}{}{Just business. One good turn deserves another.}
{407}{}{So this is how you feel about being a Blue Shields member? At least it's honest.}
{408}{}{So what's the deal?}
{409}{}{Our courier from the Big City has disappeared. Probably killed or something. You need to take the package to the customer instead.}
{410}{}{What kind of product are you supplying to Phoenix?}
{411}{}{Hydrocarbons, right? We have a whole tank of them. Craftsmen in Phoenix make all kinds of dope and useful liquids from it.}
{412}{}{Who should I take the package to?}
{413}{}{Usually the raw materials are purchased by a dealer in the slums. Don't forget to get the exchange package from him.}
{414}{}{Alright, I'll deliver the package.}
{415}{}{I appreciate the efficiency. But remember - the dealer must not be harmed.}
{416}{}{Got it.}
{417}{}{You're kidding. I didn't join the gang to carry packages. Find someone else.}
{1417}{}{You're kidding. I didn't join the gang to carry packages. Find someone else.}

{420}{}{I have your dope.}
{421}{}{Hmm, you really keep your word. I probably should've treated you better.}
{422}{}{[More]}
{423}{}{Here's your payment and a little something extra. Now you can kick back.}
{424}{}{That's right.}
{425}{}{Your dealer's gone. Looks like you're out of dope.}
{426}{}{How did this happen?}
{427}{}{I have no idea.}
{428}{}{Got it. Damn it, I'll kill that bastard if I find him. Alright, nothing more to be done now.}
{429}{}{Later, Rio.}
