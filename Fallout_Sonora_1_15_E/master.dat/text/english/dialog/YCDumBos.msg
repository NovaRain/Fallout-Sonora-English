{100}{}{You see Isaac.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in worn-out work clothes.}
{102}{}{Looks like I have to do everything myself again...}
{1102}{}{Looks like I have to do everything myself again...}
{103}{}{Great job... for a smoothskin.}
{104}{}{This is the engine room. I hope everything works here; otherwise, the station will be useless.}
{105}{}{We're almost there. Lead me to the control panel in the control room.}

{200}{}{Never thought I'd see a normie here. You must have a burr up your ass?}
{201}{}{Newbie and straight into the fire? That's what I like to see! But be careful, it's very dangerous around here.}
{1201}{}{Newbie and straight into the fire? That's what I like to see! But be careful, it's very dangerous around here.}
{202}{}{Senor Gustavo sent me to lend you guys a hand. How can I help?}
{203}{}{And what are you doing here?}
{204}{}{We're trying to do the impossible - get the dam to generate electricity. Problem is, the upper section has been taken over by military robots since the Great War. They don't let anyone inside.}
{205}{}{Where do you need to get to?}
{206}{}{I need to get to the control center. It's somewhere in there. If you could find us a safe path through, that'd be great. I'm not ready to become part of the local flora just yet.}
{207}{}{Alright. First, I'm gonna try to find a route on my own.}
{208}{}{Okay, come with me. I know how to get by the robots.}
{209}{}{First, tell me, what is this place?}
{210}{}{This is the Bonita Dam. It was created to store water - a reservoir. The power station was built during the hard times before the War, when there was a shortage of liquid fuel. Its capacity is barely enough for Dayglow's needs. But there's no other surviving station in the city.}
{211}{}{We have to get to the control center. I think we're on the right track.}
{212}{}{This is the control center. Looks like it hasn't been cleaned in ages. No matter, we're used to it... And this must be the control panel? Just a moment... There... Done. Hm-m. The station is mothballed. We'll have to work manually.}
{213}{}{What needs to be done?}
{214}{}{We need to start the second turbine in the engine room. This could be seriously tough.}
{215}{}{Got it.}
{216}{}{This is the engine room. But we need to get to the control center.}
{217}{}{Wait here.}
{218}{}{Follow me.}

{220}{}{This dam will be no more than a uselss piece of concrete until we get it to work for Dayglow.}
{221}{}{Don't tell me you're lost.}
{1221}{}{Don't tell me you're lost.}
{222}{}{Wait a bit. I'll be back soon.}
{223}{}{What needs to be done now?}
{224}{}{The second turbine is spinning.}
{225}{}{Hm, if the turbine is working, why isn't there any power? Maybe some wires are burnt out. Check the entire circuit from the turbine to this room.}
{226}{}{You've got to be kidding me...}
{227}{}{Alright.}
{228}{}{Seems like there's no break in the circuit now.}
{229}{}{Indeed... Now I'll route power to the substation... Damn, the substation isn't responding. It must be mothballed too. You'll have to go there and start it up. Remember: we need to direct the power strictly to the power lines in San Ysidro and the Old Town. Other circuits need to be shut off.}
{230}{}{Got it!}
{231}{}{Feels like I'm doing all the work here...}
{232}{}{Oh, Bonita, do you hear that? That beautiful crackling in the transformers, the hum running through the wires... haven't heard anything like it in ages. Thanks, amigo. Hope Gustavo rewards you well. Here, take this Geiger counter - you'll need it on your way to San Ysidro.}

{233}{}{Goodbye, Isaac.}
{234}{}{But there are impassable ruins between the power station and the residential areas...}
{235}{}{You're sharp! Even though you're not from our era. We're ghouls, but we've already launched several work robots and prepared the power lines. It doesn't take much.}
