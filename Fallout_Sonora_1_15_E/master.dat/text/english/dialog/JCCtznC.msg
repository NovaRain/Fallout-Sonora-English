{200}{}{Stop! Have mercy! Don't kill me!}
{201}{}{Fine. Live for now.}
{202}{}{Tell me what happened here.}
{203}{}{It's the Rangers! They attacked with their fire sticks, killing all the males, all the females, and all the pups...}
{204}{}{How did you survive?}
{205}{}{I was catching iguanas for my pups in the wasteland. When the strangers arrived, I watched from afar... Damn Rangers!}
{206}{}{And you left your kids to fend for themselves?}
{207}{}{I... (falls to her knees) I couldn't... Terror and hunger weakened me...}
{208}{}{Live with it. I'm leaving.}
