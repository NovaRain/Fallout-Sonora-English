{100}{}{You see a ghoul scavenger.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul, carefully examining some items.}

{200}{}{Hey, stop, don't come any closer! These are my things, I found them, fair and square!}
{201}{}{They *were* yours - now they're mine.}
{202}{}{Okay, whatever you say. They're yours.}
{203}{}{Hmm, it's rare to meet normies here... Well, I mean it's rare now. There used to be crowds on these streets. Now it's just bones poking out of the sand everywhere.}
{204}{}{What are you doing here?}
{205}{}{I'm looking for valuable stuff in these ruins. Scavengers rarely came here before because of the border robot. But someone did us a big favor by disabling it.}
{206}{}{Then I wish you luck. Goodbye.}
{207}{}{Have you found anything valuable yet?}
{208}{}{Sure, look here...}
{209}{}{[Barter]}
{210}{}{Hello, little human. Do you need anything from the ruins? I can look for what you need. I'm almost giving stuff away. And for you, there's even a discount.}
{211}{}{Not today, friend.}
{212}{}{Show me what you have...}
{213}{}{Come back - maybe in a couple of days. I'll find something else useful by then.}
{214}{}{Goodbye.}
{215}{}{Hey, do me a favor and don't touch my things. Okay? I found them, fair and square.}
{216}{}{Hmm, so I'm not the only one wandering these ruins anymore... Ah... there used to be crowds on these streets. Now it's just bones poking out of the sand everywhere.}
