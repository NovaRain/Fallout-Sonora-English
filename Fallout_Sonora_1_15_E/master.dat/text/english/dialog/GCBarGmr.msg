{100}{}{You see a bar patron.}
{101}{}{You see a relaxed local.}
{102}{}{Hey amigo, would you like to set us up with some drinks as a sign of our friendship?}
{1102}{}{Hey amiga, would you like to set us up with some drinks as a sign of our friendship?}
{103}{}{Thanks for the drink, amigo.}
{1103}{}{Thanks for the drink, amiga.}
{104}{}{I've got nothing left to bet with. Next time.}

{200}{}{Hey, look what I got. It's a stimpak. A real cure for all medical problems - once you inject yourself, it's as if the wounds vanish. Want it?}
{201}{}{What is this?}
{202}{}{I'm telling you, it's pre-war medicine. I don't know what it was made of, but it still works.}
{203}{}{This might come in handy... What will you take in return?}
{204}{}{Yeah. What will you take in return?}
{205}{}{I don't know. It's getting tricky to find anything worthwhile in the city, even if you have caps. How about a card game? You put up 10 caps, and I'll put up a stimpak. This way I can at least have fun with my time.}
{206}{}{I don't gamble, sorry.}
{207}{}{Not interested.}
{208}{}{Fine, I'm in. You ready to lose?}
{209}{}{Caps on the table first.}
{210}{}{As soon as I earn them, we'll continue. Bye.}
{211}{}{Oh yeah, baby. It's not as simple as it seems. You think that everything depends on luck, but it is equally important to know the rules and be able to count... So, let's see what happened there...}
{212}{}{Just put the cards on the table.}
{213}{}{You talk too much.}
{214}{}{So, you see, I have an ace. Did I mention that not everything depends on luck? Haha, these caps are mine now.}
{215}{}{Damn it, I won't forget this. Or you.}
{216}{}{Well, you win. At least it was a fair game.}
{217}{}{So, you see, I have a king... Huh? Where did you get that ace? Damn it, you cheated!}
{218}{}{Well, well. It was fair game. Everyone saw.}
{219}{}{Alright, you win. But don't think I'll be happy to see your face in this bar again.}
{220}{}{Ha ha, now hand over the stimpak and the caps. Adios, amigo.}
{221}{}{Watch your attitude, loser. And I'll take these.}
