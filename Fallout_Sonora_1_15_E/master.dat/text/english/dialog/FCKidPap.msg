{100}{}{You see Gray.}
{101}{}{You see a weary citizen of Flagstaff.}
{102}{}{I'm sleepy, leave me alone.}
{103}{}{*Yawn*}
{104}{}{Z-z-z}
{105}{}{Things are looking up now.}
{106}{}{I'm not moving until this stupid Brahmin gets out of the way.}

#On the city map
{200}{}{What do you want?}
{201}{}{Just wandering around, checking out the city.}
{202}{}{Your kids say they're trying to run you out of town. Is that true?}
{203}{}{Yeah, I can't pay my residence tax after losing my job.}
{204}{}{What was your job?}
{205}{}{I was a patrol leader at the garrison.}
{206}{}{Garrison work is pretty respected here, right? What happened?}
{207}{}{I got stripped of my rank for inappropriate behavior. Long story short, I got drunk and caused trouble.}
{208}{}{Is there no job for a former commander around here?}
{209}{}{Once you're forced to resign, no one wants to hire you. Everyone has their doubts about you.}
{210}{}{[More]}
{211}{}{What's left? Work in the mine, but I can't do that. I've got a big family to support. I might have to join a caravan as a guard and eventually move back to Phoenix.}
{212}{}{Is it really that bad?}
{213}{}{We moved here for better opportunities. I left everything behind in the big city. No one's waiting for us there. My Flagstaff career is over. It's a pity, it all started so well.}
{214}{}{If I hear about any jobs, I'll let you know. Bye.}
{215}{}{Sad story. Well, I gotta go.}
{216}{}{The current mine overseer isn't doing his job well. Maybe you could take his place.}

{220}{}{The mine needs a new overseer. You could replace that tyrant.}
{221}{}{Lash? I know him. He's a cruel man. I don't think he's all there in the head.}
{222}{}{He beats slaves and blames it on accidents. The workers want a new overseer.}
{223}{}{I doubt he'll give up his position voluntarily. How could I replace him?}
{224}{}{Leave that to me. I'll handle everything.}
{225}{}{What's wrong with the warden? Are you trying to scam me?}
{226}{}{I'm earning a lot of caps now, things are looking up. And it's all thanks to you.}

{230}{}{Faber has agreed to give you the position of overseer.}
{231}{}{I can't even imagine how you managed to convince him. Thank you.}
{232}{}{There's just one problem - you'll have to deliver the news to Lash yourself.}
{233}{}{It sounds easy, but I doubt Lash will want to leave voluntarily. I need someone for backup. Can you just stay close while I deal with him?}
{234}{}{Okay. Meet me at the mine...}
{235}{}{Good luck. See you around.}

{240}{}{Man, that was one tenacious son of a bitch! If it weren't for you, I'd be dead now. Thank you.}
{241}{}{Come on. It was fun.}
{242}{}{He almost killed us!}
{243}{}{I don't know why you're helping me, but I'll remember you and won't let my own ambitions cloud my judgment. Under my leadership, justice and law will be upheld.}
{244}{}{Good luck. See you around.}
{245}{}{If it weren't for you, that conversation would have definitely ended in a fight. Thank you.}
{246}{}{As you can see, everyone can be negotiated with.}
{247}{}{You know, fighting isn't always the best solution.}
{248}{}{This is your doing, right? Well, anyway, I'm just glad it's one less thing to worry about. Lash could have been a real headache for me.}
{249}{}{He had it coming.}
