{100}{}{You see a bartender.}
{101}{}{You see an ordinary bartender... you'd like to say that, if he wasn't a ghoul.}
{102}{}{Enough with the drunken brawls! Stop it! They're going to wreck my bar!}

{210}{}{What do you want, you bag of bones?}
{211}{}{Nothing for now. Goodbye.}
{212}{}{I want a drink and a bite. What do you have?}

{220}{}{Is Steve Morgan here?}
{221}{}{He just left. What do you need with that walking corpse?}
{222}{}{I've got "business" with him. It's about courier work.}
{223}{}{Not the best business "partner". He's been craving money since the War, but can't even afford a new car. Haha, just kidding. Anyway, he said he was heading back to the Hub. He mentioned it while sitting on the same stool you're on.}
{224}{}{When's he leaving? Right now? Damn, maybe I can catch him on the road...}
{225}{}{You should've told me that right away, idiot!}
{226}{}{What are those rogue scavengers doing here?}
{227}{}{My bar is open to anyone who pays. Butler doesn't mind regular people in the city either. He's trying to establish trade with the Hub. As long as the scavengers don't cause trouble, we tolerate them.}
{228}{}{Got it.}

{230}{}{Do you have anything stronger than old beer?}
{231}{}{Good liquor has become a real rarity. What they find in the ruins is usually sold to northern-bound caravans, and the bar is left with whatever swill remains.}
{232}{}{That's a shame. I was hoping for a good drink...}
{1232}{}{That's a shame. I was hoping for a good drink...}
{233}{}{I could scavenge for some good stuff in the ruins for you.}
{234}{}{Bring me any, and I'll gladly pay triple the price.}
{235}{}{Deal. I'll bring you all the hard liquor I find in the ruins.}
{236}{}{You're in luck. I happen to have a bottle of pre-war whiskey with me.}
{237}{}{(Opens the bottle, sniffs, tastes.) Excellent quality! This drink is worth good money. Here's your share - }
{238}{}{ caps. Bring me any more you find.}
{239}{}{Count on it.}
{240}{}{I have a bottle of pre-war whiskey for your bar.}

{241}{}{Gomer and I are looking for his squad. Have you heard about them or seen them?}
{242}{}{I've heard that super mutants have set up camp in Balboa Park. They're not aggressive, quite the opposite. Maybe that's the squad you're looking for.}
{243}{}{Got it. Thanks.}

{260}{}{I want to exchange dollars for caps.}
{261}{}{No problem. Today's exchange rate is }
{262}{}{ caps.}
{263}{}{Not today. I'll wait for the exchange rate to improve.}
{264}{}{Another time. Let me see your menu instead.}
{265}{}{[Exchange 1 dollar]}
{266}{}{[Exchange 2 dollars]}
{267}{}{[Exchange 3 dollars]}
{268}{}{[Exchange 4 dollars]}
{269}{}{[Exchange 5 dollars]}
{270}{}{[Exchange 10 dollars]}
{271}{}{[Exchange ALL available dollars]}
{272}{}{What's the matter, a hole in your pocket? It happens.}
{273}{}{Yeah, that's right...}
{274}{}{Here you go.}
{275}{}{Thanks.}

{280}{}{I wanna rent a room.}
{281}{}{For you, it'll be }
{282}{}{ caps.}
{283}{}{Why so much?}
{284}{}{Because you're a smoothskin.}
{1284}{}{Because you're a smoothskin.}
{285}{}{That's not fair!}
{286}{}{Don't like it? Sleep under the open sky.}
{287}{}{Alright, I'll be staying one night.}
{288}{}{No, thanks.}
{289}{}{No can do pal. All the rooms are, uh, occupied.}
{290}{}{Really? You're not, uh, bullshitting me, are you?}
{291}{}{Hmm... that's too bad.}
{292}{}{You know, if we had free rooms, I'd rather give them to super mutants than to you.}
{293}{}{I'll remember that, mutie.}
{294}{}{Didn't want to stay here anyway. Let's just forget it.}
{295}{}{You don't have enough caps do you... Go earn some first.}
{296}{}{Fine.}
