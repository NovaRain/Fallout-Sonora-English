{100}{}{You see a vault dweller.}
{101}{}{You see a vault dweller. They appear remarkably clean and fresh, especially compared to typical wastelanders.}

{110}{}{Good day... or is it night already? What's happening outside?}
{111}{}{Please, we mean no harm! We're peaceful people!}
{112}{}{We've called this vault home for as long as we can remember. Where did you come from?}
{113}{}{Raiders have been trying to breach our defenses for months now.}
{114}{}{How did you manage to gain entry?}
{115}{}{This vault is our sanctuary. We've nowhere else to turn.}
{116}{}{Surviving in the desert would be impossible for us. Please, don't chase us out!}

{120}{}{Thank you for saving us from the horrors of the outside world!}
{121}{}{We're truly grateful for repairing the life support system.}
{122}{}{Ah, it's refreshing to feel the cool air circulating in the vault again!}
{123}{}{Without your intervention, we'd have been forced to abandon our home.}
{124}{}{You're a true hero, unlike those despicable raiders.}
{125}{}{Did you know the first overseer of this vault was a man named Van Buren?}
{126}{}{Thank you so much for your help.}
{127}{}{We simply wouldn't stand a chance out in the unforgiving desert.}
