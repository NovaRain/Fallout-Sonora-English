{100}{}{You see a townsperson.}
{101}{}{You see a rough-looking local, clearly worn by a hard life.}

{200}{}{What do you want?}
{201}{}{Just curious about life in this town.}
{202}{}{Life's crap, like everywhere else. But we got clean water. That's something, I guess.}
{203}{}{So why are the streets so empty?}
{204}{}{Listen, stranger. Casa Grande's got a messy past. Best not to dig into it. Got it? Good.}
{1204}{}{Listen, lady. Casa Grande's got a messy past. Best not to dig into it. Got it? Good.}
{205}{}{Sounds like you've got regrets.}
{206}{}{Everyone here's lost something. We lost our home and our son. Don't expect folks to open up to a stranger.}
{207}{}{I understand. Sorry for prying. Goodbye.}
{208}{}{They say everyone's full of crap. I'll leave you to yours.}
{209}{}{Whatever.}

{210}{}{You again?}
{211}{}{Relax, just passing by.}

{220}{}{I'm looking for the family of a boy named Cody.}
{221}{}{Cody? That's our son's name... Haven't heard from him since the Tinsmiths took him.}
{222}{}{Sounds like the same Cody.}
{223}{}{So he's alive? We never hoped... But there are nasty rumors about the Tinsmiths. How's he doing?}
{224}{}{He's brainwashed, forced to work, but he seems okay.}
{225}{}{Figures. He's one of them now, working on metal, probably forgotten us. Best leave it that way. Hope he doesn't hate us.}
{226}{}{I'll see if he remembers. Goodbye.}

{230}{}{I heard Cody wasn't just taken. You *sold* him.}
{231}{}{Shut up! Who are you to dig into our business?}
{232}{}{Hold on...}
{233}{}{We were desperate! The settlement was dying without water. We had to fix the pump, even if it meant giving up our kids. Now you come stirring up the past. Just leave us alone.}
{234}{}{You're right. It's not my place to judge. Goodbye.}
{235}{}{I hope Cody's better off now.}
