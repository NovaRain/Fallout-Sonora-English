{100}{}{You see Paladin Dobbs.}
{101}{}{You see a tough, unshaven man.}
{102}{}{Watch your back, rookie.}
{103}{}{Return to base and report your findings to Paladin Latham. Dismissed.}
{104}{}{It was an honor to fight with you.}
{105}{}{You're facing a tribunal!}

{200}{}{How long do I have to wait for you, soldier? You're paid for your service, not for sightseeing!}
{201}{}{Sorry, sir! But I, uh, need to take a leak, sir! Be right back!}
{202}{}{You locals are damn lazy. I'll give you five minutes, rookie!}
{203}{}{Yes, sir!}
{204}{}{Reporting for duty. Awaiting further instructions.}
{1204}{}{Reporting for duty. Awaiting further instructions.}
{205}{}{Listen up, everyone! The enemy camp is ahead. Our primary objective is to free the captured caravan driver. We need him alive. Neutralize the raiders by any means necessary. Any questions? Let's move into position!}
{206}{}{Yes, sir.}
{207}{}{Alright, listen up! We've got ourselves a job to do. The enemy fort ahead is no joke - it's fortified, and chances are they've rigged traps along the perimeter. Keep your eyes open and watch your backs once we hit the ruins. The main objective is intel: find out everything we can about that raider base. After that, we torch the whole damn camp. Got it? Any questions? No? Good. Move out!}  
{208}{}{This is it, soldiers - our chance to make history! The raider scum have been hiding too long, but we finally tracked down their main base. Now's the time to clear out every last one of those mole-rat bastards! Stay sharp, stay tight, and let's give 'em hell. Forward, brothers! For Glory of the Brotherhood, and for the future we're building!}  
{209}{}{Yeah!}
{210}{}{...Wait. There's a special task for you. Find the cargo the raiders stole from the caravan.}
{211}{}{You're just in time.}
{212}{}{We've been waiting for you.}

{220}{}{Report.}
{221}{}{Report the situation.}
{222}{}{What's the matter, recruit?}
{223}{}{Proceeding, sir.}
{224}{}{[CHEAT: I completed my task]}
{225}{}{Now head back to base and report to Paladin Latham. Safe travels.}
{226}{}{I'm on it, Sir Dobbs.}

{230}{}{I need fire support, sir. Follow me...}
{231}{}{I'll go alone to avoid detection. Wait for my signal.}
{1231}{}{I'll go alone to avoid detection. Wait for my signal.}
{232}{}{Hold it, rookie! What are you doing leaving the operation area without permission? Did you even complete the task? Well? I'm waiting for an explanation!}
{1232}{}{Hold it, rookie! What are you doing leaving the operation area without permission? Did you even complete the task? Well? I'm waiting for an explanation!}
{233}{}{No, I... failed the mission. I'm sorry, Paladin...}
{1233}{}{No, I... failed the mission. I'm sorry, Paladin...}
{234}{}{A Deserter, huh? Never set foot on the base again, unless you want to face a tribunal. Get out of my sight!}
{235}{}{Alright, sir...}
{236}{}{I don't care.}

{240}{}{Remind me of my task.}
{241}{}{You should have listened more carefully, rookie! Find the hostage and take him to a safe place - to the evacuation point. That's your main task. We'll handle the rest.}
{242}{}{Find out where the main raider base is. Beat that information out of anyone or find some damn map, soldier. Move it!}
{243}{}{Locate the cargo the raiders stole from the caravan. Among the items, there should be a valuable pre-war relic. We need it back at base. Your participation in combat isn't required. Clear? Good luck, soldier.}
{244}{}{Got it.}
{245}{}{The hostage is safe.}
{246}{}{Very good. Losing such a valuable caravan would be an unforgivable loss.}
{247}{}{Thank you, sir.}
{1247}{}{Thank you, sir.}
{248}{}{The hostage is dead. I'm sorry, sir.}
{249}{}{Dead? Damn... Fine, no more mercy for these scum.}
{250}{}{Yes, sir...}
{251}{}{I found out where the base is.}
{252}{}{Good job, recruit. This is why we're here.}
{253}{}{I recovered the relic. Here it is, Sir Dobbs.}
{254}{}{Great job, warrior!}
