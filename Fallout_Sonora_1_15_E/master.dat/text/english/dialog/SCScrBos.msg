{100}{}{You see Maura.}
{101}{}{You see the High Scribe of the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{102}{}{I'm not in the mood to talk right now.}
{103}{}{}

{110}{}{Ah, I miss Sophia's lectures.}
{111}{}{Sometimes I miss Vree's advice.}
{112}{}{It's been a while since I've heard any letters from Lost Hills.}
{113}{}{Nonsense. The experiments at Casa Nueva are safe.}
{114}{}{It's inhumane, but research is more important than the life of one native.}
{115}{}{}
{116}{}{}
{117}{}{}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{Stop. Do you have clearance to be aboard the ship?}
{201}{}{I don't have clearance, and I don't need it. Got it?}
{202}{}{That's interesting. Stop right there and don't move. Now I'll call the paladins... Stop, I said! Damn it...}
{203}{}{Uh-oh...}
{204}{}{Yes, I have clearance. Everything is fine.}
{205}{}{In that case, greetings, stranger. I am Maura, Master Scribe of the Brotherhood of Steel. It's not often that civilians are allowed here. What brings you to our ship?}
{1205}{}{In that case, greetings, stranger. I am Maura, Master Scribe of the Brotherhood of Steel. It's not often that civilians are allowed here. What brings you to our ship?}
{206}{}{I'm on an important mission.}
{207}{}{Alright... But still, I'll be checking with the guards as to why they let you through.}
{208}{}{As you should, no doubt, Scribe Maura.}
{209}{}{Better mind your own business, scribe.}

# Re-dialogue
{210}{}{Greetings, stranger.}
{1210}{}{Greetings, stranger.}
{211}{}{Greetings, brother.}
{1211}{}{Greetings, sister.}
{212}{}{Goodbye.}
{213}{}{May I ask you a few questions?}
{214}{}{Hmm. I may be able to answer a few.}
{215}{}{That's all my questions.}

# Questions
{220}{}{I met a prisoner on the way here.}
{221}{}{Yes, we do employ prisoners for repairs on the ship. But I must advise you - it's best not to engage with them.}
{222}{}{A very good use of otherwise wasted resources.}
{223}{}{The individual you met committed a crime and is now serving his sentence. We've given him a second chance - an opportunity to repay his debt. I hope he recognizes the mercy in that.}
{224}{}{However, um... he says he only took a few cobs of corn from a huge plantation.}
{225}{}{Ah, but that's the usual defense, isn't it? And even if true, theft is still theft. Criminals often diminish their wrongdoings when recounting them. I suspect it wasn't just corn, and likely not as small a matter as he'd have you believe.}
{226}{}{Now I understand. Can I ask another question?}
{227}{}{Either that, or you're just covering up your slave-owning ambitions.}
{228}{}{Absolutely not! History shows that forced labor is a short-term solution at best, and rarely without grave costs. There's no need to revert to such brutal practices when true criminals can serve their time working for the good of society. It's about justice, not exploitation.}
{229}{}{You may be right.}
{230}{}{Well, I had other questions.}
{231}{}{Is it humane to put a collar on him and force him to work?}
{232}{}{Humane? The man broke the law, and he's fortunate to be alive. Our methods may seem harsh, but they ensure that justice is carried out with the least harm possible, both for him and society.}
{233}{}{He says he took just a few cobs from a huge plantation to survive.}
{234}{}{Can you tell me who's who on the ship?}
{235}{}{So you aren't the ones behind slavery in Arizona?}
{236}{}{No, of course not. However... I won't deny that some of our allies have overstepped their authority. This wasteland is lawless, and even the noblest can sometimes lose their way.} 

{240}{}{Tell me about this ship.}
{241}{}{This is the destroyer *Wockelgeusing*, DD-1862. She measures 130 yards in length, 13.6 in width, with a draft of 4.77. If only she were fully operational - her engines could still reach a remarkable speed of 35 knots.}
{242}{}{Sounds impressive. What else can you tell me?}
{243}{}{Destroyer? What does that mean?}
{244}{}{A destroyer, yes. It means she's armed with nuclear torpedoes, each one capable of erasing an entire city from existence. I suppose every soldier dreams of witnessing their power firsthand. Thankfully, we've never had cause to unleash them.}
{245}{}{Can this ship... sail?}
{246}{}{Not at the moment, no. We're short on nuclear fuel for any significant voyage, and the ship's hull and equipment are in dire need of repair. We understood this was a one-way journey when we set out - until we could establish a stable base here.}
{247}{}{Why are some doors locked?}
{248}{}{There's good reason for that. Certain areas on this ship contain highly sensitive equipment that requires the utmost caution. Even within our ranks, errors occur, and so only High Paladin Dixon is granted access to those places.}
{249}{}{I see. Thanks for the answers.}

{250}{}{Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{251}{}{What would you like to know specifically about our order? We have a storied history, rich with purpose.}
{252}{}{Enough talk about the Brotherhood. It's clear now.}
{253}{}{Where did you all come from?}
{254}{}{Our origins lie in California. For many years, we remained quietly tucked away in our bunker, keeping to ourselves and avoiding the chaos of the outside world. But our time of seclusion has passed - now, we extend our reach. This is just one of many outposts.}
{255}{}{Tell me the story of the Brotherhood.}
{256}{}{Our order was founded during the Great War by General Maxon, who led our ancestors to an old military base where we endured the darkest of times. Generations have come and gone since, and now his descendant carries the torch, guiding us forward.}
{257}{}{What is your mission? What do you ultimately hope to achieve?}
{258}{}{Our mission is to recover and preserve ancient technologies, with the ultimate goal of restoring order to a once-great country. Yet, within the Brotherhood, there is debate. For years, we remained passive, but recent events in California have forced us to reconsider our role and step into the light once more.}
{259}{}{Country? What country are we talking about?}
{260}{}{The United States of America.}
{261}{}{What are these events in California that you mentioned?}
{262}{}{A tale of great consequence, involving the Master and his fearsome army. If you'd like, I can share the details.}
{263}{}{Yes, please tell me.}
{264}{}{I'm not interested in this story. Let's change the subject.}
{265}{}{Um, let's go back a little.}
{266}{}{Thanks. I've heard enough about the Brotherhood.}
{267}{}{Since I'm now also a member of the Brotherhood, I want to hear an honest answer. What is the leadership REALLY trying to achieve here?}
{268}{}{This is strictly off the record, but our primary mission in Arizona is to secure nuclear material for the headquarters back in California. They also require other critical resources. While the Brotherhood can sustain itself for now, those supplies will eventually deplete. When that time comes, our leadership may have to resort to more drastic actions to ensure the Brotherhood's continued survival.}
{269}{}{So, survival of the Order is of first priority, even if it means sacrificing the locals? It's all pretty clear now.}

{270}{}{The Master was a tyrant - deluded into believing he was some kind of god. He built a church in his own name, forming a dangerous cult. Many were drawn into his influence, some used as mere subjects for cruel experiments. The most successful... well, they became the soldiers in his personal army.}
{271}{}{Sounds like the master was planning to rule the world or something.}
{272}{}{And you, of course, decided to deal with him when *you* were threatened?}
{273}{}{Yes... our scouts risked their lives to give us intel on the situation. Eventually the church was destroyed, and his army defeated. The remnants settled in the wastelands, but our troops quickly found them and erased them from history.}
{274}{}{Seems like the Brotherhood really knows how to fight a war. I doubt whether you have any match in Arizona.}
{275}{}{Arizona has yet to face the challenges we did in California. You should count yourselves lucky that we're here now.}
{276}{}{Thanks for your story.}
{277}{}{Very informative.}
{278}{}{}
{279}{}{Your story sounds a little far-fetched. Come on, you must be embellishing things just a little?}
{280}{}{You question my word? If you ever find yourself in California, ask the locals. Though I must warn you, rumors spread like wildfire in the wasteland. Take the story of the Vault Dweller, for instance - you can choose to believe it, or dismiss it as mere legend.}
{281}{}{It's really not a good idea to believe rumors.}
{282}{}{Well, in this case I think I'll choose not to believe.}

{288}{}{What kind of person is he?}
{289}{}{Beware of Dixon. With just a snap of his fingers, a village could be reduced to ash. That's all you need to know.}
{1289}{}{Beware of Dixon. With just a snap of his fingers, a village could be reduced to ash. That's all you need to know.}
{290}{}{Can you tell me about your commander-in-chief?}
{291}{}{General Dixon is one of the most esteemed Paladins in the Brotherhood. His military acumen and political savvy are unmatched - qualities that would leave most modern rulers envious.}
{292}{}{Uh, I see.}
{293}{}{General Dixon stands among the highest ranks of the Brotherhood. Few have the same depth of experience in long campaigns and battlefield operations far from home. He has earned the trust of the Brotherhood Council.}
{294}{}{And you?}
{295}{}{Thanks. I don't need to know more.}
{296}{}{He's a soldier, and I'm a scribe. Naturally, we approach things from different perspectives. Dixon has little patience for bureaucracy and prefers direct action. Conquest comes easier to him than negotiation.}
{297}{}{And the headquarters trusts a die-hard warrior?}
{298}{}{The Council doesn't always agree with Dixon's methods, no. But this outpost is far from headquarters, and the challenges we face require unique solutions. Dixon has been given special powers to act with more freedom than most. I believe those powers are justified given our circumstances.}
{299}{}{Thanks. This clears things up.}

{300}{}{It seems that I am now under your command. I'm a scribe too.}
{301}{}{I'm glad you've chosen knowledge over weaponry. It's a wise path, and I'll be more than happy to assist you along the way.}
{302}{}{I'm listening.}
{303}{}{Please do, er... ma'am.}
{304}{}{This is an analytical neurolink for your Pip-Boy. It's the standard model used by our scribes. Use it to be more attentive and insightful.}
{305}{}{Thank you, Sister Maura. I'll use this for the benefit of the Brotherhood.}
{306}{}{Alright then. Sounds like it'll come in handy.}

# Belief in mistakes
{310}{}{So you're just regular invaders.}
{311}{}{I'm not sure why I should even entertain such talk. Keep going, and I'll have the paladins escort you off the ship.}
{312}{}{Sorry. I got a little carried away...}
{1312}{}{Sorry. I got a little carried away...}
{313}{}{Does it really bother you? Throwing me off the ship won't change that.}
{314}{}{You can't shut me up! And if you try, I'll butcher the lot of you!}
{315}{}{In other words, you've come to take things that don't belong to you, and to conquer territory.}
{316}{}{Mind your words. The Brotherhood doesn't see it that way. Thanks to General Dixon's leadership, Arizona has seen progress - education, medicine, and industry at levels unheard of in nearly a century. Isn't such a miracle worth some cost?}
{317}{}{Maybe a miracle. Or maybe a mirage?}
{318}{}{It's hard to argue with that. Goodbye, Scribe Maura.}
{319}{}{Your propaganda has no effect on me, scribe. Adios.}
{320}{}{Still harping on this? You'd best watch your tongue, or the paladins will deal with you.}
{321}{}{Sorry. I don't want any trouble. Goodbye.}
{322}{}{So no counter-argument, scribe? Got it.}
{323}{}{General Dixon is wrong. His policies promote and support slavery. You understand this very well.}
{324}{}{Perhaps. But what do YOU mean when you say he's wrong?}
{325}{}{Dixon is playing a ruthless game. Through his local 'vassals', he imposes tyranny, seizes resources, plunders technology, and practices slavery.}
{326}{}{I don't know what more I can say. Perhaps we should just end this conversation here.}
{327}{}{I partly agree. However, these are all necessary measures. The locals have lost their connection with the Old World, to what they once were. They've become wild, and lost the threads of culture that once linked them, and us. Without our intervention, these threads will never be bound together again, they'll never return to the fold of civilization.}
{328}{}{I don't know what to believe. Let me think on this.}
{329}{}{I've visited many settlements. Your influence on these lands is not as wonderful as you present it.}
{1329}{}{I've visited many settlements. Your influence on these lands is not as great as you make it out to be.}
{330}{}{Really? Haven't our operatives in Phoenix established peace and order in the city? Didn't our intervention give Arizona cap currency? Didn't Two-Sun's production and Flagstaff's mine create a growing network of commerce?}
{331}{}{Oh, you have done these things. But these things compose your expansion, an expansion that takes people's freedom, destroys their traditions, and subjects them to slavery.}
{332}{}{Really, you can't argue with that. You speak the truth.}
{333}{}{Hmm. Give me examples from the places you have visited.}
{334}{}{Well, let's skip this for now. I don't want to delve too deeply into this argument at the moment.}
{335}{}{'Lord' Aaron, now unchallenged in Phoenix, is building a so-called 'empire' and crushing dissent. Doesn't really sound like freedom, does it?}
{336}{}{A whole war broke out in San Brahmin. Phoenix versus the peaceful herder tribes of the desert. Is this your wonderful influence?}
{337}{}{Two-Sun's Tinsmiths are quite brutal. They pay for slaves to be sent to their deaths in search of technology which they then hoard.}
{338}{}{Casa Grande. Visit the local cemetery to see how your wonderful influence has condemned the population to bloody water wars.}
{339}{}{Casa Nueva is like a pen for a herd of brahmin. Without you, these people are weak and would never survive.}
{340}{}{Well... I doubt our path too. But I haven't find a solution that satisfies everyone.}
{341}{}{Really?}
{342}{}{This outpost has done little good for Arizona. We have no right to invade, strip the locals of their resources, and force them into labor. It goes against the very principles of the Brotherhood.}
{343}{}{Well, there you go.}
{344}{}{And this isn't so much the fault of the order or the elders, but the result of Dixon's ambitions. But he can't be stopped, and a new general is unlikely to change course.}
{345}{}{It's good you see that. But maybe we've delved too deep. Let's end it here.}
{346}{}{We must stop this evil. Help me.}
{347}{}{I'm sorry. But I can't help you.}
{348}{}{Goodbye, Scribe Maura.}
{349}{}{We must stop this evil. Help me. Your mistakes led to my home, my people, falling victim to slavers.}
{350}{}{I'm so sorry all this happened. Take this key. It detonates nuclear torpedoes in the lower hold of the ship. Set the timer before the explosion and run as fast as you can into the desert. The Brotherhood has no place in the lands of Sonora.}
{351}{}{Thank you, Scribe Maura.}
{352}{}{Go ahead, my friend.}
{1352}{}{Go ahead, my dear.}
