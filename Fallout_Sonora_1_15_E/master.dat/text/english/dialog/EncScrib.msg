{100}{}{You see a scribe.}
{101}{}{You see one of the Brotherhood of Steel scribes.}
{102}{}{Thanks again.}

{200}{}{Hey, thanks for the help. The raiders wanted to get information about the Brotherhood out of me. But thanks to you, they won't be getting anything.}
{201}{}{What kind of Brotherhood?}
{202}{}{Oh, so you don't know? The Brotherhood of Steel is an ancient order dedicated to the preservation and study of old-world technologies. Our base is located in the old port, among the ruins of Puerto Penasco.}
{203}{}{I see.}
{204}{}{Thanks again for saving me. When I get back to our base, I'll make sure to mention you.}
{205}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{206}{}{I couldn't pass by without helping a brother.}
{207}{}{Brotherhood!? I'm gonna kill every one of you!}
