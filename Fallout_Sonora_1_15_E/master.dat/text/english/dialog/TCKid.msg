{100}{}{You see Romeo Six.}
{101}{}{You see one of the Tinsmiths. He looks very young, almost a teenager.}
{102}{}{Use the surgery skill to remove the implant.}
{103}{}{Following the Tinsmith's instructions, you manage to remove the chip from his body.}
{104}{}{Outsider? Here? Perhaps I should recheck my weapons...}

# First dialogue
{200}{}{(You see a wide-eyed teenage Tinsmith; he studies you with interest) Man from the wasteland, you should know that in Two-Sun we do not like strangers. You had better not test our patience.}
{201}{}{}
{202}{}{Hey kid, I just want to talk.}
{203}{}{Go away. We are not allowed to talk to you. (turns around and walks away from you)}
{204}{}{That wasn't very kind...}
{1204}{}{Psheww. What a rude way to treat a lady...}
{205}{}{You sound a little hesitant. Are you lonely here?}
{206}{}{(stops in bewilderment) The Collective considers it unproductive to communicate with underdeveloped strangers... unless it yields benefits.}
{207}{}{The Collective thinks so. And how do you think?}
{208}{}{Hey, who are you calling underdeveloped?}
{209}{}{Typical primitive reaction. Even if there were a fusion cell generator in your village, and the authorities used laser weapons, you would still remain a primitive.}
{210}{}{If communication with a "primitive" is unproductive, then why do you still talk to me? Do you have some doubt about things?}
{211}{}{I've heard enough of your crap. Goodbye...}

{212}{}{Are you suggesting we leave soon?}
{213}{}{The team considers you a destructive element and suggests avoiding contact.}
{214}{}{Yeah, it's not easy to earn trust here. Goodbye, Tinsmith.}
{215}{}{Who's the destructive one here? Remember, I won't tolerate this next time.}
{216}{}{(hesitates) First... Talk to Master Hard first.}
{217}{}{Great, I'll remember that.}
{218}{}{Yes... No...}
{219}{}{No?}

# Dialogue at the toilet
{220}{}{I can't talk right now. Meet me at 22:00 behind the hotel.}
{221}{}{Okay.}
{222}{}{This is not a good place. Meet me behind the hotel.}
{223}{}{Okay.}
{224}{}{They won't hear us here.}
{225}{}{Seems like you were hesitant last time when talking about your Collective. Is something worrying you?}
{226}{}{Worried? I think, yes. The Collective teaches that our past is unimportant, we must forget it and live in the future for the sake of Progress. But I can't just give up my... my... childhood.}
{227}{}{Childhood? So you're not from here?}

{228}{}{Two-Sun used to be closed to outsiders. But when the population declined, the Collective had to rebuild the population with children from other settlements. I was accepted and re-educated at the age of five. I haven't seen my family since then.}
{229}{}{I travel a lot... maybe I could watch out for your relatives.}

{230}{}{Could you really do that? Great... But my file says that my relatives died during the war in Casa Grande. Talk to the locals there. I just want to know what happened the day we were separated.}
{231}{}{Why not ask the other Tinsmiths directly?}
{232}{}{The Collective doesn't like it when you disturb order. If you disobey the majority opinion you can be punished severely. Such punishments have already happened. I don't want to test the Collective's patience on myself.}
{233}{}{ }
{234}{}{ }
{235}{}{Perhaps I can help, but traveling to another city is not easy.}
{236}{}{I could get some of our technology if you're interested. But don't expect much, I have low security clearance.}
{237}{}{Okay, I'll look for your parents.}
{238}{}{(perking up) Great! That is... (makes a blank face) I would be grateful... Now we better split up before we raise suspicion. And don't tell anyone about this of course.}
{239}{}{No problem.}
{240}{}{Actually, I doubt I'll be back this way, so I'm sorry.}
{241}{}{Oh that's... too bad... But if you do end up in Casa Grande, then please, remember me. And now we better split up. Pretend this conversation never happened.}
{242}{}{No problem.}

{250}{}{(surprised) Me? Well... Can... can we communicate in private?}
{251}{}{I don't see any problem with that.}
{252}{}{So, so, now you need something, huh?}
{253}{}{(looks around) Can we communicate in private?}

{260}{}{Come to the outhouse behind the hotel at 10:00 p.m.}
{261}{}{All right.}
{1261}{}{Oh, a date with a Tinsmith? This is intriguing. I'll come.}
{262}{}{Go on a 'date' to an outhouse? Nope.}

# Dialogue when the quest is open
{300}{}{Do you have any news for me?}
{301}{}{I'll be back when I find something.}

# Quest - family died
{302}{}{I found your family, but they're... gone. Don't worry, the Tinsmiths had nothing to do with it.}
{303}{}{I figured as much... The Collective always said not to cling to the past. Who knows if we would even understand each other after all these years apart? Thanks to you, I can finally move on. I won't let my feelings cloud my judgment anymore.}
{304}{}{That's your call to make.}

# Quest - GG found a family
{310}{}{Your family is still alive in Casa Grande.}
{311}{}{They're alive?! Tell me everything!}
{312}{}{You might not like their story. They claim the Tinsmiths took you during a raid.}
{313}{}{So, my metal kin have been lying to me?! This is what I feared... Master Hard won't like me digging into this. Especially now...}
{314}{}{I did my part. You'll have to figure out the rest.}
{315}{}{No, I need proof, or the deal's off.}
{316}{}{Alright. What do you need?}
{317}{}{For sure. Do you want to go back to them?}
{318}{}{I can't stay in Two-Sun until I get this sorted. I need to meet and talk to my family. But Master Hard won't let me go willingly.}
{319}{}{I'll talk to Hard, see if your family can come to Two-Sun.}
{320}{}{Even I can't sway him. And you think you can?}
{321}{}{I'll try. Wait for news.}

{322}{}{You have to run.}
{323}{}{Alright, I'll help you escape. What do we need to do?}
{324}{}{I can try to join a caravan, but first I need this tracking chip removed. It's implanted under my neck skin. Help me get rid of it! I can't do it alone.}
{325}{}{Okay, let's do this...}

{326}{}{So, what's the plan?}
{1326}{}{What's next?}
{327}{}{Wait a bit longer.}
{328}{}{But then you'll face serious punishment from your own people.}
{329}{}{I've always been an outsider here... Maybe it's my emotions talking, but I'd rather risk my position here and return to my family.}

# Quest - Hard was convinced
{330}{}{Hard has agreed to meet your family in Two-Sun. You don't have to go against the Collective anymore.}
{331}{}{How did you manage that?! Even his closest associates can't argue with Master Hard easily. And you're not even a Tinsmith. Amazing... I mean, thanks. With your help, I can finally deal with this. This means a lot to me.}
{332}{}{Glad we could resolve this.}

{335}{}{Your chip is no longer a problem. You can leave Two-Sun.}
{336}{}{It didn't even hurt. I knew I wouldn't be able to come to an agreement with Master Hard. Thanks to you, I can finally deal with this.}
{337}{}{Safe travels.}

{340}{}{I think you should know this. The Tinsmiths didn't take you away, but accepted you as payment for repairing the water pump.}
{341}{}{I... was *sold* by my parents?! This changes everything... Master Hard won't like me digging into the past, especially after this. Still, thanks to you, I can move on.}
{342}{}{It's time to put an end to this and, as you say, move on.}
{343}{}{It's your choice.}

# Final dialogue
{400}{}{Thanks for all your help.}
{401}{}{You're welcome.}

{410}{}{You promised me something.}
{411}{}{Of course. What do you need?}
{412}{}{Give me some time to think.}
{413}{}{Here, take this. From here, our deal is completed.}
{414}{}{A deal's a deal. Take care.}

{420}{}{I'd like some caps.}
{421}{}{I need micro fusion cells.}
{422}{}{A pneumatic fist, the one the Tinsmiths are known for.}
{423}{}{One of your pneumatic spears.}
{424}{}{Can you get night-vision goggles?}
{425}{}{A laser pistol would be perfect.}
{426}{}{I really need some explosives.}

{430}{}{Can you get a fusion cell for a generator?}
{431}{}{Oh no, I can't. Those cells are the most valuable items we produce. Their production and disposal are planned a year in advance.}
{432}{}{Hmmm. Got it.}
