{100}{}{You see a merchant.}
{101}{}{You see the caravan manager.}
{102}{}{I heard about such armor, but thought it was fiction.}

{200}{}{Hey there, traveler. I've been hauling my caravan through this hellhole for months now. I know the lay of the land. Need something?}
{1200}{}{Hey there, traveler. I've been hauling my caravan through this hellhole for months now. I know the lay of the land. Need something?}
{201}{}{What advice can a dust-covered wastelander like you give me? I'm wasting my time.}
{202}{}{Yeah, I could use some advice.}

{210}{}{Well, what can I do ya' for?}
{211}{}{Nothing, I'm good. See you.}

#Questions
{220}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{221}{}{Casa Grande's the only oasis between Two-Sun and Phoenix. Caravans stop here for clean water and a rest. Aside from that, this place is a real dump.}
{222}{}{Why's this town such dump?}
{223}{}{Who the hell knows? We caravaners bring in loads of caps, but the locals can't even afford basics. Highwaymen are part of the problem, but that ain't the whole story.}
{224}{}{Yeah, it looks like an abandoned junkyard.}
{225}{}{Well, we shouldn't judge too harshly. Folks here are just trying to survive like everyone else.}
{226}{}{I want to know more.}
{227}{}{What are those big containers behind the fence?}
{228}{}{That's the water pump. Only thing keeping this place alive. Without it, these ruins would be deserted.}
{229}{}{}

{230}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{231}{}{Technically, Don Bustos is the mayor. Honestly, I'm not sure what he actually does, but no one makes a move without his say-so.}
{232}{}{After Don Bustos died, John Sullivan took over. Maybe he appointed himself, who knows.}
{233}{}{Hard to say. Since the mayor and the pump owner bit it, no one wants to step up.}
{234}{}{Got it. Another question.}
{235}{}{Where can I find the mayor?}
{236}{}{His mansion's down the main street. If ya' go there, keep your weapon holstered and don't make any sudden moves. His bodyguards ain't exactly friendly.}
{237}{}{Maybe I'll visit him later. Let's keep talking for now.}
{238}{}{I'll go see him now. Later.}
{239}{}{}

{240}{}{What's the news around here?}
{241}{}{Not much. Same old wasteland crap.}
{242}{}{Got it.}
{243}{}{Someone trashed the local cemetery. The mayor's pissed and put a bounty on the culprit. Who'd do such a thing?}
{244}{}{Any other news?}
{245}{}{Saw a bunch of radscorpions south of town. If yer' heading out, take some antidote.}
{246}{}{What else?}
{247}{}{Word is Don Bustos was killed by highwaymen. No one wants to talk details.}
{248}{}{Anything else?}
{249}{}{People say Bustos is drinking himself to death in his mansion. The old bastard's losing his edge. Tequila won't help him.}
{250}{}{Anything more?}
{251}{}{The bathhouse is back in business. Feels good to get clean, huh?}
{252}{}{That's... interesting. What else?}
{253}{}{There used to be a bathhouse, but it's closed now. No one knows where the owner went. I was hoping for a wash.}
{254}{}{Anything else?}
{255}{}{Everyone's buzzing about the hostage situation at the bar. You probably know more than I do.}
{256}{}{Water pump prices went up after the Tinsmiths fell. This caravan route's getting rough.}
{257}{}{That's useful. Anything else?}
{258}{}{The Blue Shields gang stopped hitting caravans. No one knows why, but the roads are safer.}
{259}{}{Good to know.}

{260}{}{How can I make some caps around here?}
{261}{}{For an outsider, trading's your best bet. The mayor might have something if ya' can get on his good side.}
{262}{}{I'll keep that in mind.}
{263}{}{That's all I've got.}
{264}{}{Got it.}

#Shipping to Phoenix
{300}{}{Where's your caravan headed?}
{301}{}{We'll be heading back to Phoenix soon.}
{302}{}{Safe travels. Before you go, can I ask a few more questions?}
{303}{}{Take me with you. I need to get to the big city.}
{304}{}{Sorry, no room. Don't need extra baggage.}
{305}{}{I'll pay.}
{306}{}{I get it. But can you answer a few questions first?}
{307}{}{No offense, but I can't take a chance on strangers. The road's too dangerous.}
{308}{}{I understand, no worries.}
{309}{}{Cross me on the road, and I'll remember this.}
{310}{}{Alright. For }
{311}{}{ caps, I'm willing to tolerate the extra load. But don't take too much; we don't have an extra brahmin to carry it all.}
{312}{}{I can't afford it. Guess I'll go alone. See ya.}
{313}{}{I'm more interested in your answers right now.}
{314}{}{Here's the caps. Let's go.}
{1314}{}{Here's the caps. Let's go.}
{315}{}{Who's gonna carry all this? Bring no more than fifty pounds.}
{316}{}{Okay.}
{317}{}{I don't work for free.}
{318}{}{Of course...}
{319}{}{You'll be safe with my caravan.}
{320}{}{[Wait for the caravan to leave]}
{321}{}{I promise this won't be a problem.}
{322}{}{We'll see. Anything can happen out there.}
{323}{}{True...}
{324}{}{If it's a problem, you can dump me on the highway with my stuff.}
{325}{}{Fine. But I don't work for free.}
{326}{}{Of course...}
{327}{}{Alright. We'll consider it a deal.}
{328}{}{Great.}
{329}{}{I'll pay another }
{330}{}{ caps for the load.}
