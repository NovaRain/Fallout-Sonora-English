{100}{}{You see a ghoul.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in combat armor and helmet.}

{200}{}{John spoke about you. Said you're a smart one. You ready to storm the island with that smooth, baby face?}
{1200}{}{John spoke about you. Said you're a smart one. You ready to storm the island with that smooth, baby face?}
{201}{}{I'm ready. You don't need to worry about that.}
{202}{}{I can handle whatever's thrown at me, ghoul.}
{203}{}{John spoke about you. Said you're a smart one. Hope you realize the risks waiting for you on the island?}
{1203}{}{John spoke about you. Said you're a smart one. Hope you realize the risks waiting for you on the island?}
{204}{}{Yeah... might need to prep a bit for the landing.}
{205}{}{I understand the risks, ghoul.}
{206}{}{John spoke about you, but I didn't expect to see Gustavo's people here. What's going on?}
{207}{}{Yeah, he's short on people. Gustavo will oversee the operation.}
{208}{}{Gustavo will oversee the operation. Clear to you?}

{210}{}{Alright. Here's the plan. We have a transponder. The shore defences won't fire on us while we're in its range. Just need to launch the boat and head to the island. Then we play it by ear.}
{211}{}{I need time to prepare. Wait a bit.}
{212}{}{Okay. What's my objective on the island?}

{220}{}{Isn't this base destroyed? What's there to take?}
{221}{}{The whole island got hit by nukes. The surface is still a wasteland, but some underground levels made it through. Robots come out from there and go back for repairs. This base was one of the biggest in pre-war America, so even after the bombs, there's bound to be some valuable relics left.}
{222}{}{There's probably heavy radiation there.}
{223}{}{Exactly. That's why only ghouls and robots can handle it. Works in our favor, really. But you'll need to be well-prepared if you don't want to get fried by those isotopic rays.}
{224}{}{What's stopped you from landing there until now?}
{225}{}{Coronado Island's got big guns. Some survived the bombings under shields, stretching along the whole coastline to keep us away. There's also concrete forts, debris in the water, underwater mines, and patrolling robots. We also didn't have a transponder with a base-friendly ID - and nice work on helping set that up, by the way.}
{226}{}{What is my objective on the island?}  
{227}{}{For you, our smooth-skinned friend, the goal is simple-disable the internal security system so the robots and turrets stop shooting at everyone indiscriminately. After that, we'll take care of figuring out what and how to extract from the island.}

{250}{}{Ah! Do you feel that beautiful fresh air?}
{251}{}{I only feel radioactive dust from scorched earth.}
{252}{}{Well, tastes vary. Just remember - your job's to disable the internal security system. We'll handle the rest. And don't go messing with everything; there's still plenty of nasty military tech that could turn you to ash.}
{253}{}{Got it, Captain Obvious.}
{1253}{}{Task understood, Captain Obvious.}
{254}{}{Alright.}
{255}{}{Your goal is to disable the security system. We'll take it from there. But don't go touching everything - there's still a lot of dangerous military toys here that could turn you into a pile of ashes.}
{256}{}{Security system deactivated. The base is wide open.}
{257}{}{Great job! We'll take it from here. You can head back to the mainland.}
{258}{}{Okay.}
{259}{}{By the way, what are you planning to do with what you find here?}
{260}{}{Take them out, of course. Anything useful, from ammo to electronics, goes towards improving Dayglow or for trade.}
{261}{}{So some of these dangerous toys will end up in people's hands?}
{262}{}{Of course. Any problems with that?}
{263}{}{No, sir. None.}
{264}{}{Of course! Those things in the wrong hands will be a disaster! I'm not gonna let you take anything from here...}
{265}{}{Anything useful, from ammo to electronics, goes towards improving Dayglow.}
{266}{}{Alright.}
