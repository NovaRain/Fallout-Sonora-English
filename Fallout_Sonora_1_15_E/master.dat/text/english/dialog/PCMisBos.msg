{101}{}{You see your old friend - Field Commander Crook, back from San Brahmin. He looks cheerful and thoroughly drunk.}
{102}{}{Hey buddy, how did they manage to get you through that mess? Bar-r-dak!}
{103}{}{Damn it...}

{200}{}{Ugh, just leave me be. My head's killing me.}
{201}{}{Let me soak in this lovely bed a bit longer.}
{202}{}{I need to sleep off all that tequila I slammed down.}
{203}{}{All I want is some shut-eye...}
{204}{}{*Hic*}
{205}{}{Bring me some water... or maybe a revolver.}
{206}{}{I just need a quick nap.}
{207}{}{Let me catch some Z's, and then we can get back to it.}

{210}{}{Hey, look who it is! Grab yourself a drink.}
{211}{}{Remember how we took those savages down? Good times!}
{212}{}{And when we showed their leader who's boss? That was sweet.}
{213}{}{Now everyone in the neighborhood is scared of you and me, my friend.}
{214}{}{Has Aaron hooked you up with your reward yet?}
{215}{}{How about we get hammered and teach this bartender a lesson?}
{216}{}{Hey, can someone get me that girl from the stage?}
{217}{}{Man, after a whole bottle of tequila, I can only pee boiling water.}
{218}{}{Keep your guard up, amigo.}
{219}{}{Let's stir up some chaos! Who's up for a fight?}
