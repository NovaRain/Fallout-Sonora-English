{100}{}{You see Nick.}
{101}{}{You see one of the citizens of Casa Nueva.}
{102}{}{At night, we sleep and don't disturb each other. It's best not to break this rule.}

{200}{}{Hi, I'm Nick. How can I help you?}
{201}{}{Nice to meet you, Nick. Can I ask you a few questions?}
{202}{}{I don't care about your name. But I need to know something.}
{203}{}{Nevermind. I gotta go.}

{210}{}{How can I help you?}
{211}{}{What do you want from me?}
{212}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{213}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}

{220}{}{Of course.}
{221}{}{Thanks, Nick. Goodbye.}
{222}{}{Sorry, uh, but you better talk to the mayor first. Otherwise we'll have problems.}
{223}{}{Are you serious? OK...}

{230}{}{Who are you?}
{231}{}{I told you, my name is Nick.}
{232}{}{What are you doing here, Nick?}
{233}{}{What could someone with that name be doing in a place like this?}
{234}{}{I'm working. I used to work at a concrete plant, but it recently closed.}
{235}{}{Your dedication is impressive. Few people are willing to put in such effort. However, there's something else I wanted to ask.}
{236}{}{Used to? Not doing much now, are you? Well, here is something you can do -- answer a couple of questions for me.}
{237}{}{You must have plenty of free time. Will you answer a couple of questions?}

{240}{}{How did you end up in this town?}
{241}{}{You know, it's not common here to ask about the past. We are building a new life to replace the old one. But if you care so much, I came from Casa Grande. It's a small town on the way to Phoenix. Surely you've passed through it?}
{242}{}{Casa Grande, you say? No, never. Thanks for the info. What else can you tell me?}
{243}{}{Trying to sound smart? Of course I know Casa Grande. I have a few more questions.}
{244}{}{Yes, I have. What about the rest of my questions?}
{245}{}{How free are you here? Can you leave if you want?}
{246}{}{Why leave this paradise? There's only desert around, and in large settlements, there's nothing but suffering. Yes, here I lose some of my freedom. But in exchange, I receive shelter and food. First, we must survive and build a new world, and only after that talk about freedom. That's how it is in times like these.}
{247}{}{Inspiring speech, Nick. Life here really is better than the rest of Arizona. Can you tell me anything else?}
{248}{}{Only weak people don't go against the wind. I hope you have enough strength to at least answer a couple of questions.}
{249}{}{I get it. Can I ask you one more question?}
{250}{}{Where is Casa Grande?}
{251}{}{In the middle of Interstate 10 between Phoenix and Two-Sun. I can show you on the map.}
{252}{}{Thanks.}
