{110}{}{Who's there? Tell me who you are.}
{111}{}{Let me feel your face.}
{112}{}{So, you're one of the normals? Don't touch me!}

{114}{}{Leave Dayglow alone!}

{120}{}{Who's there? Who are you?}
{121}{}{I know every ghoul in this place. But I don't know you.}
{122}{}{You're a ghoul, and I'm a ghoul. Why haven't we crossed paths?}
{123}{}{I've been in the dark for what feels like forever.}
{124}{}{Tell me... what does Dayglow look like?}
