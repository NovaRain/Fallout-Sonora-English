{100}{}{You see the Guide.}
{101}{}{You see a person in an old travel cloak. Their head and hands are wrapped in bandages.}
{102}{}{This is where our paths part. To return to Sonora, wait for the next caravan by this flag.}
{103}{}{Pleasure to meet you, smoothskinned one.}

{200}{}{Child of humanity, this place is dangerous for one such as yourself.}
{201}{}{It's dangerous for you too. What are you doing here?}
{202}{}{Hmm. Have you encountered GHOULS? People with decaying, pockmarked skin, who live for ages? I seek them to guide them to the ruins of San Diego.}
{203}{}{Why are you guiding them to the ruins of San Diego?}
{204}{}{Necropolis was once our home. But when the super mutants came, the city was abandoned, and ghouls were forced to scatter across the wasteland. We were pushed out of every place we tried to settle until we finally built a new home - Dayglow. It's a haven for all ghouls and mutants ready to share our struggles.}
{205}{}{I'd like to see this place. Can I join you?}
{206}{}{That's nothing to do with me then. Goodbye.}
{207}{}{In Dayglow, you might die from the radiation, smoothskin. And even if you survive, the ghouls probably won't welcome you. People have always pushed us out. Think carefully if you're ready for that kind of trial.}

{208}{}{I don't really feel like I have a place in this world either. Visiting a new place could do me good.}
{209}{}{Some mysterious stranger invited me to Dayglow. I can't ignore that.}
{210}{}{This doesn't really sound very inviting. I think I'll pass on this trip for now. Goodbye.}
{211}{}{Well, the decision is yours.}
{212}{}{Tell me about the journey.}
{213}{}{Why are the ghouls gathering in San Diego?}

{220}{}{Our paths cross again. Could it be fate?}
{221}{}{No, it's just a coincidence. Goodbye.}
{222}{}{I want to go with you to Dayglow.}

{230}{}{Great Set! You remind me of the ghouls of Necropolis in the early stages of the disease. But I don't remember you. Are you a new child of the Master?}
{231}{}{I'm not from Necropolis, nor a child of the Master. Someone named Levi made me this way.}
{232}{}{Levi? I know him. He is one of the Master's finest works. But he looks down on those like us. So, you're a victim of his experiments? I pity you. Now you will taste the full bitterness of ghoul life.}
{233}{}{I'm fine as I am. Don't know why you're so down.}
{234}{}{I've tasted it already - everyone avoids me. Even my kin.}
{235}{}{}
{236}{}{}
{237}{}{Then come with us. We are building a home for those like you and me.}
{238}{}{A home for mutants? Where is it?}
{239}{}{Ghouls are building a new city in the ruins of San Diego. A world of their own. I'm seeking and guiding all ghouls who still have some sanity left. You'd find a home there too.}
{240}{}{Alright. I'll go with you to San Diego.}
{241}{}{I can't leave these lands yet. But I'll keep in mind that there is a place in the wasteland where I'm welcome.}

{250}{}{You'll have to leave your friends behind here. You can only take the essentials, no more than 20 pounds. Through the scorched lands, you need to travel light - swift as the wind.}
{251}{}{No way. I'm not leaving my stuff behind!}
{252}{}{Can I come back if I don't like it there?}
{253}{}{Return - yes. But you can count on my escort only once.}
{254}{}{Then I need to think about this. I'll seek you out if I decide to go.}
{255}{}{I'm ready to set off.}
{1255}{}{I'm ready to set off.}
{256}{}{Soon you'll find yourself in another world, friend.}
{1256}{}{Soon you'll find yourself in another world, friend.}
{257}{}{[Embark on the journey]}
{258}{}{You have too many items.}
{259}{}{I've got too much stuff. I'll come back after I stash it somewhere.}
