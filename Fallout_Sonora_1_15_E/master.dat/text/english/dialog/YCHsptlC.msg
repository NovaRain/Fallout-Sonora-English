{100}{}{You see a ghoul named Zerah.}
{101}{}{You see a regular ghoul. He's a bit battered after an encounter with the rogue scavengers.}
{102}{}{Z-z-z...}
{103}{}{Leave me alone!}
{104}{}{As Zerah said, there was pre-war money in the mailbox, }
{105}{}{ dollars.}
{106}{}{Your diagnosis: this body is dead.}
{107}{}{Good idea.}

{200}{}{And who are you?}
{201}{}{Oh, brother, help me. These bastards are gonna kill me.}
{1201}{}{Oh, sister, help me. These bastards are gonna kill me.}
{202}{}{I'll untie you... And now let's get out of here. Quietly!}
{203}{}{You're in a tight spot. I can help if you tell me where your caps are.}
{204}{}{Okay, okay! I will! Just get me out of here.}
{205}{}{Shh. Lie there and keep quiet.}
{206}{}{Hey, guys! There's some normie wandering around here!}
{207}{}{You bastard...}
{208}{}{Shut up!}

{210}{}{Thank you, brother. Once again, you prove that only ghouls can be trusted.}
{1210}{}{Thank you, sister. Once again, you prove that only ghouls can be trusted.}
{211}{}{Thanks for saving my ass. I never thought a normie would care about it.}
{212}{}{What did these raiders want from you?}
{213}{}{They're just regular rogue scavengers. But they don't want to take risks in the ruins, so they rob those who will. But I don't know any good spots or have any stashes.}
{214}{}{Well, at least you're okay. Be more careful out here from now on.}
{215}{}{You're lying. Tell me where your stash is!}
{216}{}{Okay, okay, calm down! I threw all my bills in the mailbox at the entrance to the hospital when the scavengers were chasing me. But that's all I had.}
{217}{}{I'm gonna check. Pray that they're there.}
{218}{}{Alright, you can go free.}
{219}{}{Hush! They might hear us! Let's get to the street first.}
{220}{}{Alright.}
{221}{}{Don't worry. All the rogue scavengers are already dead.}
