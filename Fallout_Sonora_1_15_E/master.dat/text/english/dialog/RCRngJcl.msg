{100}{}{You see Ranger Jason.}
{101}{}{You see your old friend from the Jackal dens. Looks like he's recovering.}

{200}{}{So, we meet again. Thanks to you, I'm still standing, still holding the line.}
{201}{}{You look better since the Jackal incident.}
{202}{}{The journey was tough, but we're trained for that kind of hardship. Listen, we need people like you. Join the Rangers! My recommendation alone won't cut it, but still, I've put in a good word with Commander Helford. You should talk to him.}
{203}{}{I'll consider your offer.}
{204}{}{The journey was tough, but we're trained for it. By the way, I saw your name on the list of new recruits. Congratulations on making it as a Ranger. I know you'll use your position to help the folks out in the wastes.}
{205}{}{Thanks, Ranger Jason, for the warm welcome. But I have to be on my way.}
{206}{}{So many words, and they still won't give me my own personal rifle. Well, until next time.}

{210}{}{I'm glad you stopped by.}
{1210}{}{I'm glad you stopped by.}
{211}{}{Catch you later.}
{212}{}{What's your take on the alliance between the Rangers and the Jackals?}
{213}{}{After what I went through, it feels like a bad dream. What were they thinking at the command center?! But my job is to follow orders, not question them.}
{214}{}{Got it.}
