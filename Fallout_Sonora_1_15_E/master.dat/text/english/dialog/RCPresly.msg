{100}{}{You see cadet Presley.}
{101}{}{You see one of the new recruits.}
{102}{}{Rest in peace, cadet Presley.}
{103}{}{Hey cadet, this is no time to die!}
{104}{}{Good luck in your travels.}
{105}{}{The Milton shack is in front of us, but we need to find the entrance to the cave.}
{106}{}{Do you have a problem with the Milton family?}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{(You see a young cadet in a clearly unhappy mood; he is sitting like he is waiting for something and kicks the rubbish near his feet to relieve tension from time to time.)}
{201}{}{Why aren't you in line?}
{202}{}{Captain Agatha reprimanded me for insubordination. What's it to you?}
{203}{}{You've got quite the chip on your shoulder, don't you?}
{204}{}{Damn, I was just tired of these pointless drills! I want *real* field missions, not pretending to shoot coyotes on caravan routes.}
{205}{}{Looks like you have a lot of ambition, buddy.}
{206}{}{Maybe so. But I think waiting three more years for the first real challenge is pointless. If Commander Agatha doesn't return my equipment and doesn't send me on a mission soon, I'll just head out with a god-damn spear.}
{207}{}{Whatever you say. In the meantime, I'm going to speak with your commander.}
{208}{}{You're just a self-centered brat. Bye-bye, loser.}
{209}{}{Watch your lip with me, greenhorn.}

#Re-Dialogue
{210}{}{What?}
{211}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{220}{}{Why did you take the rifle from the warehouse?}
{221}{}{Weapons are only given out for missions and drills only. And you have to conserve ammo. I wanted to take the rifle and head to the Giers Wash cave. But the quartermaster figured out my plan quickly.}
{222}{}{What's so important about that cave?}
{223}{}{Locals say that there's a lot of rodents living in that cave, and they are seriously harming the villagers. But the Rangers are too busy to deal with such a small thing, and the commanders refuse to send cadets, since they say we're "not ready."}
{224}{}{[Continue]}
{225}{}{I wanted to solve the problem alone, myself, to show those stubborn old people how wrong they are. We should be doing something, not fooling around in the training room!}
{226}{}{Your dedication demands respect.}
{227}{}{I think you just wanted to show what *you* were capable of.}
{228}{}{What did you say about that Giers Wash cave?}
{230}{}{What is your relationship with the other cadets?}
{231}{}{Different with each. Some make me mad so I try to ignore them.}
{232}{}{Alright.}
{233}{}{Be honest, have you ever killed... a human being?}
{234}{}{Not yet. The best thing we cadets can hope for is to be sent to exterminate wolves. But I *will* kill criminal scum, as every Ranger is supposed to.}
{235}{}{Never even thought about it.}

#Quest
{300}{}{About that cave. Maybe we could head out there together.}
{301}{}{Really? But what's it to you? Why risk your own hide?}
{302}{}{I want in on the action too. It'll be fun.}
{303}{}{For sure. But they don't let us use serious weapons, saving ammo, and shooting air guns is only good for dead targets.}
{304}{}{I want to help the Rangers take on the wasteland too.}
{305}{}{Looking for friends among us, eh? Smart. Everyone needs a strong ally in the wasteland.}
{306}{}{Agatha asked me to watch over you.}
{307}{}{Really? Think I need a babysitter to shoot some common critters? Though... a partner wouldn't hurt... and a witness, just in case.}
{308}{}{So?}
{309}{}{Right! So what... But I can't go without weapons.}
{310}{}{The order for your gear is already on the quartermaster's desk. Thanks to me.}
{311}{}{What?! How did you manage that?! Awesome, I'm heading to the supply room right now. You get ready too. Meet you outside by the info center.}
{312}{}{See you later.}
{320}{}{I'm ready to move out. You?}
{321}{}{Wait a tiny bit.}
{322}{}{What do you think we should take?}
{323}{}{It'll be dark in the cave, we should take a couple of flares. And there is likely to be a lot of pig rats. Alone they're weak, but together they could be a problem. Best weapon against such a group is a shotgun. Though to be honest, I have absolutely no idea where we could get one.}
{324}{}{That's worth considering.}
{325}{}{Then we move out.}
{326}{}{Why did we go back? You forgot something?}
{1326}{}{Why did we go back? You forgot something?}
{327}{}{Don't worry, I won't take long.}
{328}{}{Fine, but do it fast.}
{329}{}{Ok.}
{330}{}{In a group like this? That isn't the best tactic for tight caves. And we'll just frighten the animals. Someone should stay behind.}
{331}{}{I'll talk this over with my companion.}
{332}{}{Listen, about that story with the Milton family. Let's agree that this had nothing to do with us at all, okay? I knew it was a mistake to go into this damn sortie. I don't think this pig rat head was even worth it. Bye.}
{333}{}{Goodbye, cadet Presley.}
{334}{}{Why... why did he do that?}
{335}{}{Are you okay?}
{336}{}{I don't know... This bandit... He had a weapon, he could have found another way to survive. But he attacked a defenseless family. Why did he do that?}
{337}{}{He didn't know of any other way.}
{338}{}{I'm not any better, right? Now I see why we had to go through all the drills at the base. Why we aren't yet allowed to do serious assignments. I'll take what the veterans say more seriously from now on.}
{339}{}{You became a bit wiser thanks to this sortie. Goodbye, cadet.}
{340}{}{Remember the key lesson of the wasteland - kill or be killed. As for me, time to head back into the desert.}
{341}{}{This was great, wasn't it? I'll go show the head to the others in the mess hall. Good luck in your travels.}
{342}{}{Goodbye, cadet Presley.}
{350}{}{Watch your back.}
{351}{}{Let's go.}
{352}{}{So, what's our goal here?}
{353}{}{Find and kill Nat-Aani. That's how the locals call the biggest and most dangerous pig rat of this cave.}
{354}{}{What does that name mean?}
{355}{}{Only that it's the pack leader. Which means it's the strongest and most ferocious out of them all.}
{356}{}{What do you know about the Milton family?}
{357}{}{Why do you care? Well, they're regular, they're poor, and they live here. They survive on fishing and gathering. Not much to say about them.}
{358}{}{Let's just drop this, okay?}
{359}{}{What the hell happened between you and the Miltons? They never seemed to be aggressive before.}

{360}{}{We did it! I'll cut that pig's head off and show it to the old guys on the base. They'll see that I'm ready for serious assignments!}
{361}{}{Is that the only reason you wanted to do this hunt?}
{362}{}{Of course. Why else would I help those bums? They're useless, and they won't give you any rewards or raise your rank no matter what you do. But for this kind of deed I'll get a double ration minimum. Ha!}
{363}{}{Hmm. Let's get out of this place.}

{364}{}{What?! What is this, a joke? I didn't expect a fight with a bandit when I was coming here!}
{365}{}{What's the matter, cadet? You were just reveling in blood, cutting off a pig rat's head a couple of minutes ago.}
{366}{}{But that's different! Ugh, dammit, what shitty timing... What do we do now?}
{367}{}{We have to act. Now. If we wait for help, he'll just run away or prepare for a siege. Someone would likely die in that case.}
{368}{}{Exactly. Right now the odds are stacked in our favor. He isn't expecting us to show up. But still, we should be careful - man isn't an animal, he's smarter.}
{369}{}{Let's go.}
{370}{}{We can't deal with a bandit with just a shotgun. We have to run for the base.}
{371}{}{Exactly. But while we do that he's gonna get ready and might even kill someone if we come after him. It would be better to just get outta here and keep this to ourselves.}
{372}{}{Let's go.}
