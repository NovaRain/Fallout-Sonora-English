{100}{}{You see Corwin.}
{101}{}{The kitchen duty officer stands before you, humming a silly song about beans.}
{102}{}{Now's not the time to chat with the locals.}
{103}{}{?}

{110}{}{~ Beans... beans... beans... beans... ~}
{111}{}{~ Send a salami to your boy in the Army ~}
{112}{}{~ Yes, the Navy gets the gravy... ~}
{113}{}{~ ...But the Army gets the beans ~}
{114}{}{~ Beans, beans, beans, beans, beans, beans ~}
{115}{}{~ Navy service is ideal ~}
{116}{}{~ Printed menus ev'ry meal... ~}
{117}{}{~ ...And they decorate your plate ~}
{118}{}{~ In the Army we get chow... ~}
{119}{}{~ ...That you wouldn't feed a cow ~}

{200}{}{Na-na-na... Lu-boo-doo... Cough-cough-cough... Ugh.}
{201}{}{Hey.}
{202}{}{Ahh! What? What's happened? Don't scare me like that.}
{203}{}{What are you doing?}
{204}{}{Me? Singing...}
{205}{}{This is what you call singing?}
{206}{}{You don't like it much, do you?}
{207}{}{Not really, no.}
{208}{}{But I can't change my voice... Who are you? I haven't seen you before.}
{209}{}{None of your business, private. Get back to work.}
{210}{}{No worries. The most important thing is that you enjoy it. I'm just passing through.}
{211}{}{That's right! And who are you, friend? I haven't seen you before.}
{212}{}{I'm new to the Brotherhood.}
{213}{}{Oh, congratulations. Can I get back to work now?}
{214}{}{Of course, carry on, initiate.}
{215}{}{Civilian. I have clearance.}
{216}{}{Well, it's none of my business. But no strangers are allowed in the kitchen.}
{217}{}{Alright, I'll leave now.}
{218}{}{Don't bother him.}
{219}{}{See you later.}

{220}{}{Initiate Corwin, sir... Oh, it's you.}
{221}{}{Do you really have clearance?}
{222}{}{You're lucky, you can go into the wasteland whenever you want. I've been waiting for my leave for a hundred years.}
{223}{}{Na-na, na-na, boo-boo, boo-boo...}
{224}{}{Beans... beans... beans... beans...}
{225}{}{Did they send you from the infirmary? I don't like all these needles.}
{226}{}{"Come on, Corwin!", "Wash up, Corwin!", "Boo-boo-boo, Corwin." Big bosses...}

{229}{}{Hello... I mean... Initiate Corwin, sir!}
{1229}{}{Hello... I mean... Initiate Corwin, ma'am!}

{230}{}{They told me you can get lunch here. I'm a new recruit.}
{231}{}{Ah, welcome aboard. Here's your lunch. And you'll have to pay for any extra outta your own pay. Those are the rules.}
{232}{}{Thanks, Initiate.}
{233}{}{I thought the Brotherhood would provide better food than a roadside diner.}
{234}{}{Can I buy food from you?}
{235}{}{No way. Without orders, I can only sell surplus to Brotherhood personnel.}
{236}{}{Too bad. Guess there's nothing to be done about it.}
{237}{}{You just missed out on an opportunity to get rich. Fool.}
{238}{}{Come on, you probably have some extra lying around.}
{239}{}{Listen, this could get you into trouble. And you're not even from the Brotherhood. Get out of here and stop bothering me.}
{240}{}{Fool, you just missed an opportunity to get rich. Bye.}
{241}{}{}
{242}{}{Come on, no one will notice a couple of bowls of soup missing, and you get some caps.}
{243}{}{Fine, but your pay can't buy you much. Just make sure no one finds out.}
{244}{}{Of course. Everyone gets their share, Corwin.}
{245}{}{It's okay. I have permission.}
{246}{}{Well, alright then.}
{247}{}{Thanks.}

{250}{}{What's your name, private?}
{251}{}{Alvin Corwin. Currently on kitchen duty.}
{252}{}{Kitchen work seems shameful for a paladin.}
{253}{}{Well, I'm not a paladin. I haven't decided on a division yet.}
{254}{}{Are you a paladin or a scribe?}
{255}{}{Neither. I haven't chosen a division yet.}
{256}{}{Then why aren't you in training?}
{257}{}{I'm serving my sentence. Missed morning training because I was looking for the sergeant all... um... morning.}
{258}{}{Figures. A good soldier wouldn't be stuck in the kitchen.}
{259}{}{Are you kidding me? I was looking for the sergeant to ask for shore leave, but he was nowhere to be found.}
{260}{}{I guess training is pretty hard for you?}
{261}{}{I just need a break. It's been ages since I had any leave.}
{262}{}{Sounds unfair. It wasn't even your fault you got into this mess?}
{263}{}{Exactly. I really needed shore leave, but no one was around to sign the order. I ran all over the ship.}
{264}{}{What if I could get you shore leave? What would it be worth to you?}
{265}{}{Can you really do that? I'll pay you with chow or share my ammo.}
{266}{}{Consider it done.}
{267}{}{Honestly, I don't have the connections or authority. Not sure I can make it happen.}
{268}{}{I could try to get the order signed for you.}
{269}{}{Could you really? You're my last hope.}
{270}{}{I'll do my best.}
{271}{}{Come to think of it, I probably won't succeed.}
{272}{}{About that shore leave...}
{273}{}{Did you manage to get it?}
{274}{}{To be honest, no.}
{275}{}{Why do you need shore leave? It's just desert all around.}
{276}{}{There's a settlement northeast of here called Casa Nueva. Our folks patrol there, in and out. Nice spot - plenty of people, fresh air. Not like this rust bucket. By noon, it's so damn hot you'll be walking around in your underpants.}
{277}{}{I see. Well, good luck with that.}
{278}{}{Not yet. I keep wondering how I can get you that leave. Any ideas?}
{279}{}{But HOW can I get you a leave of absence?}
{280}{}{Why do you want shore leave in this deserted wasteland?}
{281}{}{If I knew how, I would've asked a long time ago. Usually, only the higher-ups can sign off on leave. You can get assigned to a unit for a mission, but they don't like sending rookies like me on those. They're more than happy to have me lug stuff around, though.}
{282}{}{Order completed. You've got four days of shore leave.}
{283}{}{Holy shit, are you serious?}
{284}{}{Absolutely. Just happy to help out.}
{285}{}{No joke. But everything has a price.}
{286}{}{I'll need caps for the shore. How about I share my ammo? These armor-piercing rounds have never been useful to me anyway.}
{287}{}{Deal, I'll find a use for them.}
{288}{}{Thanks. I'll go tell the sergeant and let him burst with envy.}
{289}{}{Go ahead, and have a nice trip.}

{300}{}{What are you doing, private?}
{301}{}{Making beans, sir.}
{1301}{}{Making beans, ma'am.}
{302}{}{Beans? That's all?}
{303}{}{Yeah. Novices don't get the good rations. Paladins eat the best.}
{304}{}{Is that why everyone here seems unhappy?}
{305}{}{They've got their reasons, I guess. I'm the one stuck cooking it, though. Sure, we get fish, meat, and cornmeal, but when supplies run thin, we're scraping by. Man, I'd kill for a proper steak right about now.}
{306}{}{I get around, but steaks are rare.}
{307}{}{Hey, can you get some coffee? We'd pool together and pay for every can.}
{308}{}{Okay. If I find some, it's yours.}
{309}{}{Coffee's pretty rare. I doubt I'd find any.}
{310}{}{Can't help you. Bye.}
{311}{}{Look what I have. A can of real coffee.}
{312}{}{Great! I'll buy it! I'll give you }
{313}{}{ caps for the can.}
{314}{}{Sorry, no deal. I want it too. I'm not giving it up.}
{315}{}{Fair trade. Settlements pay less for coffee.}
{316}{}{Thanks. If you find more, I'll buy it too.}
{317}{}{Will do.}
{318}{}{Take it for free. It's my way of thanking the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{319}{}{Thanks a lot! The guys will all appreciate it.}
{320}{}{You're welcome. Tell the guys to enjoy it.}
{321}{}{Making pasta, sir.}
{1321}{}{Making pasta, ma'am.}
{322}{}{Pasta? That's it?}
