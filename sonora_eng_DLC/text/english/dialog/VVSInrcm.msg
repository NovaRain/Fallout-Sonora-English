{103}{}{Talking over the intercom during a fight isn't the easiest thing to do.}

#First dialogue
{200}{}{(a faint but hopeful voice crackles over the intercom) Hello! Can you hear me? Who's on the line?}
{201}{}{I'm just um... a passing wanderer.}
{202}{}{Huh? Are you talking box? I'm just wandering by.}
{203}{}{Damn. I was expecting help from Phoenix... But maybe this is better. Tell me, wanderer, why are you here? Are you searching for something?}
{1203}{}{Damn. I was expecting help from Phoenix... But maybe this is better. Tell me, wanderer, why are you here? Are you searching for something?}
{204}{}{I searching for the history of my people. There were items from Vault 27 at my home, Villa. They must have come from here.}
{205}{}{Villa... Yes, I know of that place. And I know how to help you.}
{206}{}{Great! How can you help me?}
{207}{}{Not so fast. Help *me* first. I'm trapped on the lower level and can't get out on my own. You just need to find the backup generator on the residential level and start it up.}
{208}{}{Answers first. I have a lot of questions.}
{209}{}{Alright, I'll see what I can do.}

#Second dialogue
{210}{}{I'm glad you're still there. But please hurry up before I suffocate down here.}
{211}{}{I have a lot of questions.}
{212}{}{[End call]}
{213}{}{One more question.}

{214}{}{Great. If needed, use the intercom to reach me again.}
{215}{}{Alright.}
{216}{}{Intercom isn't responding.}
{217}{}{[Done]}

#Answers
{220}{}{Ask away.}
{221}{}{Who are you?}
{222}{}{Arthur Carrington, expedition leader. We were scavenging this vault for resources. You've probably already seen our gear near the tunnel.}
{223}{}{How long can you survive down there?}
{224}{}{Hard to say. I've got food and water. The air issue is fixed, but not for long.}
{225}{}{Why does the intercom work if there's no power in the vault?}
{226}{}{The old engineers were smart. They wired the intercoms to work like walkie-talkies with long-lasting batteries. Just for situations like this.}
{227}{}{What should I know before entering the vault?}
{228}{}{It's dark, no power. The air is toxic, but a gas mask should help. And take a weapon... just in case.}
{229}{}{Why do I need a weapon?}
{230}{}{Just playing it safe. This is an old vault. Even I don't know all its secrets.}
{231}{}{You didn't mention anything about these creepy freaks in gas masks before!}
{232}{}{They're basically zombies. Rotten shells of the former Vault Dwellers. We woke them when we went down. Hard to believe they're still alive... if you can even call that life.}
{233}{}{So you knew!}
{234}{}{I'm sorry, I should have warned you, but I couldn't risk losing my only chance at salvation. I'm trapped down here. Don't you get it?}

#The rescue
{240}{}{What should I do?}
{241}{}{Find a backup generator on the residential level and get it running. If it needs a new fusion cell, check the warehouse one level down.}
{242}{}{I see you got the generator going. Now find the ventilation system on the same level and start it up. This should clear out the toxic air.}
{243}{}{Is the air cleared? Great! Head down to the lower level and find the second elevator in the control center. I'll be waiting on the bottom level. If anything goes wrong, contact me through the intercom.}
{244}{}{We've got a problem. There's a crowd of... crazy, or sick, people blocking the way to the elevator!}
{245}{}{We've got a problem. A horde of zombies is blocking the path to the elevator.}
{246}{}{They're no longer people... almost mindless. You need to be cautious around them. We can't risk a fight now, better to avoid them.}
{247}{}{Maybe distract them?}
{248}{}{I thought of that too... Check the nearby rooms and try to activate some old equipment to make noise. And try not to get caught by the zombies.}
{249}{}{Alright.}
