{100}{}{You see Jose Solis.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul in a pre-war suit. He looks much neater and cleaner than other ghouls.}
{102}{}{It seems you're new around here. How about you buy me a drink and tell me a bit about yourself?}
{103}{}{My dreams of "Mariachi de Jose Solis" are over.}
{104}{}{"Mariachi de Jose Solis" is back in business!}
{105}{}{Don't distract me, I'm busy rehearsing. Shoo! Shoo!}

{200}{}{Hello, human. I heard there was a normie in town, but I thought it was just another silly joke from the old folks. And now here you are, blinding me with your pale skin and making me reminisce about the old days. By the way, my name is Jose Solis. And you are?}
{201}{}{I'm }
{202}{}{.}
{203}{}{Damn pleased to meet you, }
{204}{}{. How do you like our little hellhole? Bored already?}
{205}{}{I'm }
{206}{}{. Remember this name, ghoul.}
{207}{}{Okay-okay, }
{208}{}{. I see you're not too fond of this place. Or am I wrong?}
{209}{}{It's fine. Very livable.}
{210}{}{Strange to hear that from a normie. Feels like you're trying to pull a fast one on me. Alright. So, what brings you here?}
{211}{}{It's a bit dull.}
{212}{}{That's for sure! Even I feel like shaking this place up a bit sometimes. So, what do you need here?}
{213}{}{Nothing in particular. Just looking around. See you.}
{214}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{215}{}{Greetings, fellow unfortunate soul! I heard there's a new face in town, but not from Necropolis. What a surprise. By the way, my name is Jose Solis. And you are?}
{1215}{}{Greetings, beautiful senorita! I heard there's a new face in town, but not from Necropolis. You sure know how to surprise an old man. By the way, my name is Jose Solis. And you are?}
{216}{}{Yes, indeed. This place is even better than Necropolis. But this is just the beginning! Someday we will restore the city to its former glory-you'll lose your mind with joy. How can I help you now?}
{217}{}{That's for sure! Even I feel like shaking this place up a bit. So, how can I help you?}

{220}{}{Greetings, fellow unfortunate soul!}
{1220}{}{Greetings, my love!}
{221}{}{Greetings, }
{222}{}{.}
{223}{}{How can I assist you, }
{224}{}{?}
{225}{}{I know you, }
{226}{}{. You're always starting trouble. Be normal and don't bother me without reason.}
{227}{}{Greetings, Senor Normie.}
{1227}{}{Greetings, Senora Normie.}
{228}{}{Greetings, }
{229}{}{. I hope you have the sense not to cause any problems here.}
{230}{}{I think it's time for me to go.}
{231}{}{Well, thanks for the chat. Lately, normies have been avoiding conversation with us and instead shooting on sight. Not the most sociable bunch.}
{232}{}{Goodbye.}

{240}{}{Sure thing. Ask away.}
{241}{}{Only if you promise to leave me alone afterwards.}
{242}{}{What's going on around here?}
{243}{}{Nothing much. Just the usual routine in a big city.}
{244}{}{Hmm. Alright.}

{250}{}{Do you like it here?}
{251}{}{It's a decent town. Good climate, good people. But you know, San Diego used to be famous for its night life, its music. Now, the only song you hear is the Geiger counter's crackling.}
{252}{}{Yeah, I'd love to hear some live music.}
{253}{}{Night life? These ruins are over a hundred years old - probably haven't seen a show in all that time.}
{254}{}{Then smile, baby. You're looking at Jose Solis! My ensemble was known throughout Baja California. It was a good time. We were performing in Bakersfield when the bombs fell. I survived by a miracle. And only now am I thinking of getting back to my old craft.}
{255}{}{What's stopping you?}
{256}{}{Well, for starters, I need new strings for my guitar. It's lying in my room right now. And finding them among these ruins is no easy task.}
{257}{}{I'll find you some strings. I'm pretty good at scavenging.}
{258}{}{Gracias, senor! Together, we'll remind Dayglow of the good old times.}
{1258}{}{Gracias, senorita! Together, we'll remind Dayglow of the good old times.}
{259}{}{Goodbye.}
{260}{}{I'll find you some, if you pay me.}
{261}{}{Honestly, I don't have any caps right now. How about a share of my first earnings?}
{262}{}{I'm in. I'll find you some strings.}
{263}{}{I don't need caps or extra trouble. Goodbye.}
{264}{}{Well, good luck with that. Goodbye.}
{265}{}{Do you know where I can find any guitar strings?}
{266}{}{I've already searched all the local ruins; there are no strings here. The only option left is to head to Tijuana. It used to have a mariachi museum and some wonderful performance stages. But now it's full of robots and mutants.}
{267}{}{Tijuana, huh? Got it.}
{268}{}{Have you tried the new strings on your guitar?}
{269}{}{Oh, it sounds wonderful! Plus, my stiff skin makes it easier to press the strings now. Thank you, smoothskinned amigo.}
{1269}{}{Oh, it sounds wonderful! Plus, my stiff skin makes it easier to press the strings now. Thank you, smoothskinned amiga.}
{270}{}{No problem. When's the next performance?}
{271}{}{Don't rush me! I'm not ready yet. And the most important thing-I can't perform alone, without my wonderful companeros!}
{272}{}{Are they here in Dayglow too?}
{273}{}{Trumpeter Fernando works at the dam, and Senorita Beatriz is in the diner at the south camp. If you happen by either of those place, could you let them know I'm getting the band back together?}
{274}{}{Alright. Why not?}
{275}{}{What's in it for me if I track down your companeros?}
{276}{}{I'm in. I'll bring your companeros.}
{277}{}{I'm looking forward to seeing them again!}
{278}{}{Alright.}
{279}{}{Where can I find Fernando?}
{280}{}{Trumpeter Fernando works at the Bonita Dam.}
{281}{}{Where can I find Beatriz?}
{282}{}{Senorita Beatriz works at the diner in the San Ysidro area.}
{283}{}{Got it. I had another question.}
{284}{}{Goodbye.}
{285}{}{Fernando and Beatriz are here.}
{286}{}{Excellent! I have a lot to discuss with them. And we need to start rehearsing. You should come to our first concert, maybe tomorrow.}
{287}{}{Alright. Good luck with the rehearsal.}
{288}{}{Fernando is here. But Beatriz is dead.}
{289}{}{No... Poor Beatriz! At least she's finally at peace. Makes me a bit envious...}
{290}{}{Beatriz is here. But Fernando is dead.}
{291}{}{No... Poor Fernando! At least he's finally at peace. Makes me a bit envious...}
{292}{}{Too sad... too sad! The dream slips away like ashes through my fingers... Say... how about a hologram? I know there's one in the Chula Vista mall. Maybe it could replace my missing band members? Think you can you bring me the holographic module? I could reconfigure it to be a backup band.}
{293}{}{Seriously? Hmph. Alright, I'll have to look for that thing, otherwise you might take this all too hard.}
{294}{}{I have the holographic module. Here, take it.}
{295}{}{Fernando and Beatriz are dead.}
{296}{}{Fernando and Beatriz are dead. I'm very sorry.}
{297}{}{Excellent! I need some time to set this up, and rehearse. Definitely come to our first concert, maybe in a day or two.}
{298}{}{Alright. Good luck with the rehearsal.}
{299}{}{It's old }
{1299}{}{It's my muse, }
{300}{}{! You've taken me back to 2077. I haven't been this happy in a long time. By the way, we did great at the concert. Here's your share, 1000 caps. Thanks for your help, partner.}
{1300}{}{! You've taken me back to 2077. I haven't been this happy in a long time. By the way, we did great at the concert. Here's your share, 1000 caps. Thanks for your help, senora.}
{301}{}{Good luck, Jose.}
{302}{}{! You've taken me back to 2077. I haven't been this happy in a long time. By the way, we did great at the concert. Here's your share, 1000 caps. And from me personally, this fine century-old whiskey. Thanks for your help, partner.}

{303}{}{What will you name the band?}
{304}{}{Hmm, it needs to be something romantic. Maybe "Last Breath"? Or "Love in Hell"? How about "Kiss Before Death"? Or...}
{305}{}{I think it would be simpler to name it after you.}
{306}{}{Mariachi de Jose Solis? Of course!}
{307}{}{Well, that's great...}
{308}{}{By the way, what will you name the band?}
