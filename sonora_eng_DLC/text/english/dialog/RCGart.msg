{100}{}{You see William Garth.}
{101}{}{You see a seasoned Ranger.}

{102}{}{Remember who holds real power here.}
{103}{}{And whose blood is spilled here, you simpleton?}
{104}{}{If this is some sort of trick, you'll pay dearly for it.}
{200}{}{Hmm? I don't recall meeting you before. Welcome to Aqueduct. What brings you here?}
{201}{}{I have business here.}
{202}{}{Whatever you say. Just make sure your "business" doesn't become my problem. I don't take kindly to newcomers trying to set new rules.}
{203}{}{And who might you be?}
{204}{}{You might not recognize a fellow Ranger. I recently joined the ranks.}
{1204}{}{You might not recognize a fellow Ranger. I recently joined the ranks.}
{205}{}{Congratulations on that. Make yourself at home; here, we're all on the same team.}
{206}{}{And you are...}
{207}{}{My settlement needed the Rangers' assistance.}
{208}{}{Then speak with the commander at the info center near the dam. No one here can help you.}
{209}{}{What's your role here?}
{210}{}{I'm William Garth, former field commander, now retired. I stepped back from the action after many years of service - the years take their toll. Some mistake me for a local sheriff, but that's not the case. HQ occasionally compensates me for overseeing Aqueduct.}
{211}{}{Since you seem to have plenty of free time, care to answer a few questions?}
{212}{}{Nice to meet you, but I gotta go.}
{220}{}{Well, what's up?}
{221}{}{Speak up, don't be shy.}
{222}{}{Go ahead.}
{223}{}{I'm all ears.}
{224}{}{What do you want to know?}
{229}{}{Until next time, Ranger.}
{230}{}{I heard there's an outbreak of some sickness here?}
{231}{}{A few folks came down with a fever. They're on the mend, but we haven't pinpointed the cause yet.}
{232}{}{What are the symptoms?}
{233}{}{Why don't you speak with them; they're resting in their shacks.}
{234}{}{Got it, I'll look into it.}
{250}{}{Tell me about this place.}
{251}{}{Aqueduct's home to a few peaceful families. The river gives us fish and water, and the Ranger base keeps the wasteland's dangers at bay.}  
{252}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{253}{}{Can I stay here overnight?}
{254}{}{I won't object, as long as you mind yourself. The locals are wary of outsiders.}
{255}{}{Are there any job opportunities here?}
{256}{}{Doubt it. Could ask the locals though.}
{257}{}{I'm curious about that big man-made structure across the road.}
{258}{}{That's an aqueduct, an artificial river built by the people of the Old World. It stretches for hundreds of miles across Arizona. Impressive, isn't it? But stay clear; it's not safe.}
{259}{}{Are the Rangers okay with having civilians so near the base?}
{260}{}{Having a settlement this close feels a bit off. But it's the Rangers' job to protect these lands and everyone in them.}  

#quest - missing residents
{300}{}{There are rumors swirling about people disappearing.}
{301}{}{Who's spreading these rumors?}
{302}{}{That refugee by the campfire.}
{303}{}{Just answer the question.}
{304}{}{Occasionally, strangers pass through here, like you, but they don't stick around. That's fine. Then they move on. Sometimes the Rangers stumble upon their remains in the forest, where wolves and coyotes roam aplenty.}
{305}{}{You're like the sheriff around here. Aren't you concerned about finding those missing people?}
{306}{}{My responsibility is Aqueduct, not what lies beyond its borders. Besides, the missing folks were just transient strangers, not locals. If you're keen on finding them, do it yourself.}
{307}{}{Alright. No worries. See you later, Ranger.}
{308}{}{You're a lousy sheriff. I *will* do it myself.}
{310}{}{There are corpses at the aqueduct. You're involved with their deaths, aren't you?}
{311}{}{Damn it, I told Keel to stop you. Where's that idiot?}
{312}{}{I hate to say it, but it seems he's incapable of following your orders anymore.}
{313}{}{He tried and failed. And you won't intimidate me into silence either.}
{314}{}{Who do you think you are, barging in and stirring things up? Did the cultists send you? Or are you a bandit scouting for a raid? Maybe just a thief with an eye on our fish. Outsiders like you only bring trouble to this place. I'm just doing my job - keeping Aqueduct safe from anything that threatens it.}  
{315}{}{No, you're just crazy. And you need to be stopped.}
{316}{}{Fine. I'll leave, but you better not touch me. You'll be lucky if I don't spill the truth to everyone.}
{317}{}{Trust me, I'm on your side. If your subordinate failed, I can help.}
{318}{}{Then prove your loyalty to the Rangers - eliminate the last refugee. I don't care how - a bullet or a clever trick. Right now, he's a threat to me and the others here.}
{319}{}{Okay, I'll do it.}
{320}{}{No, this is too much. I'll deal with YOU instead.}
{321}{}{Why? Isn't there enough bloodshed already?}
{322}{}{Do you even know anything about these people? Clearly not. They arrived from afar. One of them bore the mark of the Blue Shields - a raider gang from the east. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but that's enough for ME to act.}
{323}{}{Let's see if you're really up for it then.}
{324}{}{Alright.}
{325}{}{You're new to the Rangers, so let me lay it out for you. Aqueduct's a quiet little place - fishermen, gatherers, and not much else. Too many outsiders could throw everything off balance. We get all kinds passing through - cultists, raiders, thieves. I'm just doing my job, keeping Aqueduct safe from whatever the wasteland sends our way.}

{330}{}{I've dealt with the refugee.}
{1330}{}{I've dealt with the refugee.}
{331}{}{Nice work. You're more effective than that spineless Keel. I foresee a fruitful partnership between us. Here, take some ammo. Let's keep this between us, shall we?}
{332}{}{No problem, Garth. Mum's the word.}
{333}{}{There's... a corpse by the aqueduct. Uh, you might want to take a look.}
{334}{}{Damn it, not this again. Show me.}
{335}{}{Right this way...}
