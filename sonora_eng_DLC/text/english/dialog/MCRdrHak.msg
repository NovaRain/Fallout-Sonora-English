{100}{}{You see Chuck.}
{101}{}{You see one of the Blue Shields.}
{102}{}{Hey there, how are you?}

{200}{}{Hey there. I'm Chuck. Haven't seen you around before. What's your name?}
{201}{}{You don't need to know my name.}
{202}{}{Seriously? Okay, whatever you say. Though I don't get why you're being so secretive.}
{203}{}{Your friendliness doesn't really fit with the gang's vibe. Don't you think?}
{204}{}{Yeah, that's true. I'm a newbie. Still figuring things out, haven't even been initiated.}
{205}{}{Initiation?}
{206}{}{I'm }
{207}{}{ and I'm new here.}
{208}{}{Oh, so you're new too? Finally, I'm not the only one. Nice to meet you. Have you been initiated yet?}
{1208}{}{Oh, so you're new too? Finally, I'm not the only one. Nice to meet you. Have you been initiated yet?}
{209}{}{Initiation?}
{210}{}{Oh, hi. Yeah, I'm training here... Want to become as tough as you.}
{211}{}{If you want to take my place next to Ben, you're too late.}
{212}{}{No, I'm nowhere near your level. That's why I'm training hard before initiation.}
{213}{}{Initiation?}
{214}{}{I have to go through an initiation ceremony to prove my worth to the gang. They say they'll beat me in a crowd to see how I handle it. But I worry it won't stop there.}
{215}{}{Does that bother you?}
{216}{}{Of course. I'm not sure I have the strength and endurance. They might even kill me.}
{217}{}{Then why do you keep preparing?}
{218}{}{I have no choice. After the mayor of Casa Grande murdered half the population, he declared me a traitor and put a bounty on my head. Ben is the only one who took me in.}
{219}{}{Well, good luck with your training.}

{220}{}{Hey, hi.}
{221}{}{Bye.}
{222}{}{I can help you with the test.}
{223}{}{Really? How?}
{224}{}{They say pre-war drugs can numb the pain.}
{225}{}{Yeah, I thought about that. Psycho would be perfect to take the beating. But it's rare and expensive. Can you get some for me?}
{226}{}{Yes, but I'll need some time.}
{227}{}{Great. I'll wait.}
{228}{}{Bye.}
{229}{}{No, sorry, I don't have any.}
{230}{}{Too bad. Actually, you can buy Psycho in Phoenix. But I can't go there because the local thugs have a warrant for my capture.}
{231}{}{I see. If I find some Psycho, I'll bring it. Bye.}
{232}{}{You don't belong in a gang. I want to help you clear your name.}
{233}{}{Have you thought about clearing your name and breaking the contract with the bounty hunters?}
{234}{}{Damn, I'd be forever grateful. The contract for my capture is kept in Phoenix, and the client is the mayor of Casa Grande.}
{235}{}{That sounds tough. It might be easier to get you some drugs to endure the pain.}
{236}{}{Have you thought about clearing your name and returning to normal life?}
{237}{}{I got you some Psycho.}
{1237}{}{I got you some Psycho.}
{238}{}{This dose will last the entire ceremony. Thank you, friend. What would I do without you?}
{1238}{}{This dose will be enough for the entire ceremony. Thank you, friend. What would I do without you?}
{239}{}{Just a favor for a favor. Remember who your real amigo is here.}
{240}{}{All charges against you have been dropped. You're free.}
{241}{}{Is this true? So now I can go to the city and live like a normal person?}
{242}{}{Goodbye, Chuck.}
{243}{}{No more messing around with shady characters, buddy.}
{244}{}{I'll see what I can do. Bye.}
{245}{}{Why do you keep training if you might die?}
{246}{}{Mayor Bustos is dead, which means his contract with the thugs is worthless.}
{247}{}{Really? Holy shit. I didn't know. So now I can go back to the city and live a normal life?}
{248}{}{How are preparations for initiation going?}
{249}{}{I don't know what awaits me. But they say the whole gang will beat me to test my endurance. It scares me. What if I can't take it?}
{250}{}{I see.}
{251}{}{Tell me your story.}
{252}{}{I lived with my parents in Casa Grande. They belonged to the clan that owned the water pump. But then Mayor Bustos took over the city. He seized the station and killed anyone who resisted.}
{253}{}{How did you survive?}
{254}{}{I fled just in time, and then I found out they were hunting me under some false pretext. I wandered a lot, scavenged, desperate to find a new home. Luckily, Ben took me into the gang.}
{255}{}{That's a sad story.}
{256}{}{Given the circumstances, any story here seems dubious.}
{257}{}{Exactly, Chuck.}
{258}{}{Thanks! Here, take this stimpak. I was going to use it during the ceremony, but now I won't need it. (looks around and lowers his voice) Just don't let anyone know I'm planning to run.}
