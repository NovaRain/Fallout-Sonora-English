{233}{}{Scan for signals on all frequencies.}
{234}{}{...help! The Jackals have us trapped, we need help urgently!}
{235}{}{I hear you. Where are you?}
{236}{}{Damn, finally! Listen, the Jackals have us trapped. We can't get out of here. Help us, and we won't forget it. Here are the coordinates, north of Garage City... Be careful and bring more people... Damn, they're coming... (signal lost)}
{237}{}{Hang in there, stranger. Whoever you are.}
{238}{}{Hang in there, ranger. Help is on the way.}
{239}{}{I hear you. Commander Helford sent me to help. Where are you?}

# Rangers
{240}{}{(You hear boring patrol conversations. Nothing interesting.)}
{241}{}{"...last seen in Garage City." - "They might have died on the way. Especially considering there were children among the refugees." - "Why can't they just stay in Vegas?" - "I don't know. They say there are whole wars between clans and cannibalism thrives there. We have our own problems to deal with." - "That's true. So maybe it's good they got lost in the desert. Fewer mouths to feed at the base." - "Watch what you say, civilians might hear you." - "I know, I know..."}
{242}{}{"...the ration is already inedible. When will they finally bring decent meat to the base?" - "They say the problems in San Brahmin have worsened. Until the situation is resolved, be content with what you have." - "Damn, this shit's gonna make me..."}
{243}{}{*sh-sh-sh* "...and they were driven into the ruins of Needles. The siege lasted three days until they surrendered from hunger." - "Wow, three days under the sun - that's something." - "Yeah. But the raiders turned out to be penniless. Nothing valuable to take at all..." - *psh-sh-sh* - "Stop cluttering the airwaves! Tell your stories in the mess hall." - *psh-sh-sh* - "As you say, I never refuse a lady." - *psh-sh-sh* - "Keep joking, wise guy, and I'll make sure your rations are cut for a week."}
{244}{}{*sh-sh-sh* "...they are going on the road. What should we do? Over." - "Let them go. We don't need extra trouble because of a few vagrants."}
{245}{}{"...I'll send them to the mantises!" - "Calm down, sergeant. I'll tell the guys to intercept the caravan and retrieve the stolen goods. Be more careful next time when dealing with unverified traders."}
{246}{}{"...little food. I don't know if we should help them. Our rations are also running low." - "Then keep it for yourselves. The nearest outpost is too far, it's not worth the risk..."}
{247}{}{...there was one left, but he escaped into the wasteland." - "Let him run. I'll notify the nearest patrols to intercept him." - "Thanks. But I'll catch up with him myself." - "Ranger, forget about chasing him through the desert!" - "To hell with it, I'll do it anyway." - "(pause) As you wish. But one more stunt like this, and I'll report you to the commander."}
{248}{}{*sh-sh-sh* - "Bravo team, respond!" - *sh-sh-sh* - "Bravo team, respond!.. Damn..."}
{249}{}{*sh-sh-sh*}

{250}{}{...can't believe it! Who could have done this?! - The rangers have many enemies. But if the dam was destroyed from the inside, it must have been done by one of our own. They say some newbie was seen inside the dam before this. The guards were interrogated strictly. They won't see their badge again.}
{251}{}{...at the base, be sure to check him out. That guy is a great mechanic. - I don't like dealing with teenagers. Just make sure he watches over the dam, old Rufus will soon kick the bucket, and then what?}
{252}{}{...I noticed too. What happened? - The comms officer hired some farmer to fix the antenna. Now the radio works better and over a greater distance. - A farmer? That's a twist. I should treat him to some wasteland coffee when we meet.}
{253}{}{...that fugitive was finally caught. The bastard was hiding in the subway near the farmers on Route 95. - Right under our noses? And we couldn't catch him for so long? - He was an excellent spy, we could use such. They say it wasn't even the rangers who caught him, but some drifter. - Well, at least some use from strangers. - You don't say...}

{260}{}{Ranger }
{261}{}{ on the line. I'm in the desert near the base. I need supply support. I'm gettin' desperate.}
{262}{}{*psh-sh-sh* Copy, rookie. Do you know about the town of Quartz to the south? Find the ruins opposite the bar there. They have a hidden basement with our supplies. Hope this helps you.}
{263}{}{Thanks, ranger.}
{264}{}{Scan for the source of the radio echo.}
{265}{}{You can't find the echo. The source is probably too far away.}
{266}{}{The source is still too far away. You should return to the ranger base and move due south or east from there.}
{267}{}{You have detected the source of the radio echo.}
{268}{}{Head to the location right now.}
{269}{}{}
{270}{}{Hey, rangers, has anyone seen that legendary giant radscorpion?}
{271}{}{Copy, rookie. It was last seen at these coordinates. Are you going hunting? Be careful, better not face that creature without a grenade launcher.}
{272}{}{[Go to the provided coordinates]}
{273}{}{Got it, ranger. Over and out.}
{1273}{}{Got it, ranger. Over and out.}
{274}{}{I'll keep that in mind. Over and out.}

# Motel
{290}{}{Listen on all frequencies.}
{291}{}{You pick up a faint distress signal.}
{292}{}{[Listen]}
{293}{}{[Ignore]}
{294}{}{...Anyone! Help! I'm in some old motel southwest of Phoenix. They blocked all the exits, I can't escape. Please help...}
{295}{}{[Continue]}
{296}{}{All the others have already died from traps. I'm the only one left... Someone's coming... What do you want? Go away! Oh God! Don't touch me, freak! No! Stop! Aaaah!}
{297}{}{An old motel to the southwest? Oh, this will be a tough hike...}

# Vault 27
{300}{}{The emergency frequency is transmitting a distress signal.}
{301}{}{Obviously, I'm too far from the vault. I should return to Phoenix and try different directions.}
{302}{}{This is pointless. I already know where the vault is.}
{303}{}{The signal is getting stronger in that direction. I'll try to triangulate...}
{304}{}{The signal is getting stronger.}
{305}{}{Got it! Looks like I found you.}
{1305}{}{Got it! Looks like I found you.}
{306}{}{Head to Vault 24.}

#Flagstaff
{310}{}{(You hear patrol chatter. Nothing interesting, just the usual bickering.)}
{320}{}{All posts! We are under attack! A whole horde of savages! Reinforcements needed! All... A-a-a!}
{321}{}{Understood. Sending a squad from the garrison. Hold on...}
{322}{}{(Yes, empty the garrison, idiot, that's exactly what I need)}
{323}{}{Trace the signal of the missing Tinsmith.}
{324}{}{Signal not traceable.}
{325}{}{Maybe I'm just too far from it. Need to return to the center of Casa Grande.}
{326}{}{You catch a faint signal from the Tinsmith.}
{327}{}{Alright, he's somewhere in the city. Seems the signal is coming from the east.}
{328}{}{The signal from the radio implant is clear.}
{329}{}{So, he's nearby. Him or his body.}

#Inferno
{350}{}{Brotherhood of Steel squad, respond. Can anyone hear me?}
{351}{}{(Only "white noise" comes in response)}
{352}{}{I repeat. Brotherhood of Steel squad, this is a rescue team member. Respond.}
{353}{}{Looks like they can't hear me. Over.}
{354}{}{This is Paladin Barkley... Glad to hear you, brother. We're in a tough spot. I'm wounded, lost contact with the squad. Requesting urgent assistance.}
{355}{}{Understood. What's your location, Paladin Barkley?}
{1355}{}{Understood. What's your location, Paladin Barkley?}
{356}{}{Location... Manhole near the ruined supermarket. Lots of mutants on the surface, be careful.}
{357}{}{Heading to your position. Stay put. Over and out.}
{358}{}{Hey, can anyone hear me? Over?}
{359}{}{(No one responds)}
{360}{}{I repeat. Can anyone hear me? Are there any survivors in this graveyard?}
{361}{}{Alright. Over and out.}
{362}{}{This is Barkley... Yes, at least one survivor here. Listen closely, brother. I'm wounded, need urgent help.}
{363}{}{Where are you, Barkley?}
{364}{}{In the sewer under the ruined supermarket. Come straight to me - don't waste time. And stay sharp, mutants are everywhere.}
{365}{}{Hold on, Barkley. I'm on my way.}
{366}{}{Oh, mutants? That's bad.}

{370}{}{[Scan for signal]}
{371}{}{(You carefully scan the frequencies, turning the radio receiver in all directions until finally, a sound comes from the speaker.)}
{372}{}{[Listen further]}
{373}{}{[Ignore]}
{374}{}{(Through heavy "white noise", an old tune can be heard)}
{375}{}{[Listen to the music until the end]}
{376}{}{... Hey, traveler! Tired from the road? The desert wore you out? Then head to The Hub!}
{377}{}{[Next]}
{378}{}{Here you'll find everything you need for rest: bars, hotels, a huge market... and, of course, the unforgettable "Maltese Falcon" cafe! There you can relax and forget about deathclaws and road raiders.}
{379}{}{Want to refresh yourself? We've got stocks of Nuka-Cola! And for those who prefer something hot, we'll always pour a mug of legendary Hub rum.}
{380}{}{Hey, what about slot machines? Oh yes, baby, there are very few left in modern California. Don't miss this chance!}
{381}{}{And of course, our ladies will always TAKE CARE of dear customers who felt too LONELY on the road. Drop by the "Maltese Falcon". The Hub awaits you! (the old tune resumes)}
{382}{}{Eh, it's too far. Besides, I need to go in a completely different direction...}
{383}{}{You gained experience for discovering the radio signal from California.}

{390}{}{[Listen further]}
{391}{}{"Brothers! This is Knight Jerry. I'm under attack! Super mutants cornered me in an old cafe in National City. I'm wounded. Requesting immediate assistance!"}
{392}{}{On our way, brother. Hold on as long as you can!}
{393}{}{Serves you right! Hope no one helps you.}
{394}{}{Eh, some noise, couldn't hear anything, over.}
{1394}{}{Eh, some noise, couldn't hear anything, over.}
{395}{}{Hold on, I'm coming.}
{396}{}{This is Scribe }
{397}{}{This is Knight }
{398}{}{This is Paladin }
{399}{}{This is Scout }
{400}{}{. Can anyone hear me? I'm at the ruins of Dayglow. I need supply assistance.}
{401}{}{This is Cadet }
{402}{}{Greetings, }
{403}{}{. This is Jerry from the recon squad. Head to Pier #9. I stashed some supplies there. Hope they help.}
{404}{}{Thanks, Brother Jerry. Over and out.}
{405}{}{High radiation levels on Coronado Island causes heavy interference.}
{406}{}{Seems like I need to leave the island for a proper signal.}
{407}{}{The rock blocks the weak radio signal of your walkie-talkie.}
{408}{}{Looks like I'll have to return to the surface.}
