{100}{}{You see a woman.}
{101}{}{You see a middle-aged woman. She appears exhausted from a long journey.}
{102}{}{Good luck to you.}
{103}{}{Damn them all! I hope they all die!}
{104}{}{It's over... Leave me be, let nature take its course.}

#Dialogue on the Rangers map
{200}{}{Hey, you! Get the general out here, now!}
{201}{}{Lady, stop yelling. We can hear you just fine.}
{202}{}{You've got the wrong person, I'm just passing through.}
{203}{}{Yeah, right, and next you'll say you don't serve those damn Rangers! Even the coyotes around here suck up to the strongest.}
{204}{}{You have a problem with the Rangers?}
{205}{}{That's putting it lightly! And I'm not letting it go. If the general doesn't come out and face me, I'll fight my way to him.}
{206}{}{You again? If you're not here to help, then please just get out of my sight.}
{207}{}{Hold on, I'll speak with the Rangers.}
{208}{}{Tell me what happened.}
{209}{}{The so-called "keepers of the peace" executed my husband and left me and my child to fend for ourselves in the desert. It's a miracle we made it here alive.}
{210}{}{Was he guilty of something?}
{211}{}{Guilty? Out here, everyone's guilty of something, if you believe in Ranger law. But that doesn't mean they should be executed!}
{212}{}{I understand how you feel.}
{213}{}{What do you want from the general?}
{214}{}{To look him in the eye, and tell him the truth about his men. He may not know what they're are up to, but I intend to hold him accountable for their actions and demand compensation.}
{215}{}{That's quite brave of you.}
{216}{}{Are you done with your questions?}
{217}{}{Is that your child?}
{218}{}{Yes. Why do you care?}
{219}{}{Just curious. Forget it.}


{220}{}{You can't stay here. The Rangers won't take you under their protection, and your reputation will make it hard to settle in neighboring settlements.}
{221}{}{I know! But where do we go now? The desert stretches in every direction; another journey like that would finish us. However, we could try making our way to California... It's our only chance. But the Rangers have blocked the only crossing of the river!}
{222}{}{There's talk of a crossing downstream, but it's far from safe.}
{223}{}{Exactly. I don't even have a pistol to fend off coyotes and pig rats. I can't make it to the ferry with my baby without help.}
{224}{}{I'll accompany you. Get ready to leave.}
{225}{}{I'll accompany you, but not right now.}

{226}{}{The guards are gone.}
{227}{}{I can see that, but it changes nothing. We still can't get to the General. The dam is swarming with Rangers. We wouldn't even make it to the citadel on the other side. Either snipers will take us out, or patrols will catch us.}
{228}{}{The General is dead.}
{229}{}{Are you sure about that? It's not a trick? Well, I've heard the same. Seems like he really did kick the bucket. That's a relief. But what now - I have no idea.}

{230}{}{Hey, traveler. You also trying to escape this hell?}
{1230}{}{Hey, traveler. You also trying to escape this hell?}
{231}{}{You have something to say?}
{232}{}{Maybe.}
{233}{}{The Rangers ruined our family's life. I don't want to talk about it... but they got what they deserved, if you look at that dam.}
{234}{}{Go on.}
{235}{}{You don't seem like a threat. We should stick together. Can you help me get to the other side? There's a ferry downstream, but I'm hesitant to go alone. They say coyotes, wolves, and worse lurk in these parts.}
{236}{}{Sure, I'll come with you. Let's leave now.}
{237}{}{I can't help you right now. Maybe later.}
{238}{}{Changed your mind yet? Come with us. Why stay in these wastelands? In California, you can start fresh, leave the past behind.}
{1238}{}{Changed your mind yet? Come with us. Why stay in these wastelands? In California, you can start fresh, leave the past behind.}
{239}{}{Go on.}
{240}{}{I've got my own issues with the Rangers.}
{241}{}{Is that supposed to make me feel better? Hm. Well, since we're in the same boat, we should help each other survive.}

#On the ferry map
{300}{}{Let's talk when we reach the ferry. Right now, our voices might attract coyotes.}
{301}{}{Agreed. Let's focus on getting there safely for now.}
{302}{}{Alright.}

{303}{}{I don't like how you're eyeing the child. Don't scare him, or you'll regret it for the rest of your life.}
{304}{}{I meant no harm!}
{305}{}{Threats won't work in your favor, lady.}

{310}{}{What's your name, ma'am?}
{311}{}{I'm Cecilia, and this is my son.}
{312}{}{He doesn't look much like you.}
{313}{}{He's adopted. I found him among the ruins and couldn't leave him behind.}
{314}{}{Was your husband really a criminal?}
{315}{}{I didn't ask where he got his supplies. But it was clear he was robbing travelers and farmers to provide for us. We had to survive somehow. It was worse in Phoenix; he was forced into much dirtier work there.}
{316}{}{Did you escape Phoenix?}
{317}{}{Yes... Big city. Too many people, too few resources. In the wastelands, you're honest with fate, but in the city, you're always at someone's mercy.}
{318}{}{Do you hate the Rangers now?}
{319}{}{Absolutely.}
{320}{}{They aim to prevent stories like yours.}
{321}{}{But it still happened. It's their fault. Can't undo it now.}
{322}{}{My village wouldn't condone that either.}
{323}{}{Hmm, in our Villa, every peasant follows the community's whims too. But it's different.}
{324}{}{That's commendable.}
{325}{}{Should've warned me earlier.}

{330}{}{The ferry's ready to depart. Get on; I'll take you across.}
{331}{}{I'm deeply grateful. Not everyone would help us, especially in Ranger territory. But what about you? Will you come with us to California?}
{332}{}{I can't. I have commitments to my family and home.}
{333}{}{Understood. It's rare to find people as loyal to their communities as you. Good luck to you. Thanks for everything.}
{334}{}{Go on.}
{335}{}{I have nothing to offer in return, but if you find yourself in Phoenix, tell the bartender at the casino about me, maybe he'll give you a discount. Now goodbye.}
{336}{}{[Send family to the other side]}
