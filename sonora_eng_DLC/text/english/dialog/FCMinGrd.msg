{100}{}{You see overseer Lash.}
{101}{}{You see an loud, angry man.}
{102}{}{Where's your shovel, slave? Oh, you're not one of ours... Lucky for you, otherwise I'd have whipped you until you blacked out.}
{1102}{}{You shouldn't be here, lady. This place is for criminals and slaves only.}
{103}{}{Get out of here!}
{104}{}{Stay out of my way, rat.}

{110}{}{Work, devils! You're rebuilding America!}
{111}{}{Hurry up and get to work!}
{112}{}{Move it, you worthless piece of filth!}
{113}{}{If I see a slacker, I'll whip them to hell with the pig rats!}
{114}{}{You'll get pig rat shit for dinner!}
{115}{}{Whoever works hard will get real meat!}
{116}{}{Hey, where do you think you're going? Over there! There, I say!}
{117}{}{}
{118}{}{}
{119}{}{}

{200}{}{Looking for trouble?}
{1200}{}{Well, well, what a surprise. I'd be sorry to see such beautiful hands get dirty with this ore.}
{201}{}{And you provide it, right?}
{1201}{}{As sorry as you were for that slave you beat to a pulp?}
{202}{}{Yes, I like kicking the ass of scum who babble without knowing their place.}
{203}{}{Are you talking about me, asshole?}
{204}{}{You including me, asshole?}
{205}{}{Silence! What are you doing, you piece of shit? Want to be sent to hard labor? I'll make you die on your feet! You'll eat dirt and drink your own urine! Is that clear?}
{206}{}{Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.}
{207}{}{You don't scare me. Fuck you, moron.}
{208}{}{I'LL KILL YOU, YOU FUCK!}
{1208}{}{I'LL KILL YOU, BITCH!}
{209}{}{Oh, how scary...}
{210}{}{That slave didn't deserve to be treated like that.}
{211}{}{How would you know? Only criminals and scum work here. If you want to play do-gooder, you'll fill the next vacant spot. Is that clear?}
{212}{}{Just try it and I'll show you real justice, scum.}
{213}{}{Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.}
{214}{}{No way, sir.}

{220}{}{Everyone back off! This is a criminal conspiracy! You're all... under arrest! You'll be crushing my ore with your teeth!}
{221}{}{You're out of your mind. Let's see if we can knock some sense into that skull of yours...}
{222}{}{Hey, I'm not involved. Your beef's with that guy over there.}
{223}{}{Let's discuss this peacefully, shall we?}
{224}{}{I'm not falling for that! You want to get rid of the overseer? There'll be hell to pay.}
{225}{}{Faber personally signed the order. Give it up now, before it's too late.}
{226}{}{Grrr... You're not getting away with this. I swear, you're all gonna pay!}
{227}{}{Yeah, sure.}
