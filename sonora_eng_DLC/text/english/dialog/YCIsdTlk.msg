{100}{}{You see a ghoul guard.}
{101}{}{You see a ghoul dressed in combat armor.}
{102}{}{We don't like competitors. Get out of here!}
{103}{}{Even if you were really a patrol officer, you wouldn't have any authority here.}
{104}{}{Are you allowed to be here?}
{105}{}{Big changes are coming for us.}

{200}{}{Let's get this straight right away, smoothskin. You're not welcome here. But if you behave, no one will harm you. Got it? Good. Now, tell me what you need.}
{201}{}{Welcome, brother. How's San Ysidro treating you? Do you need anything?}
{1201}{}{Welcome, sister. How's San Ysidro treating you? Do you need anything?}
{202}{}{I just want to ask a few questions about Dayglow.}
{203}{}{What do you need?}
{204}{}{Nothing. For now.}
{205}{}{Ask away.}
{206}{}{I gotta go. Thanks for your time.}
{207}{}{Got it. I've got some more questions, okay?}
{208}{}{}
{209}{}{}
{210}{}{Tell me about yourself?}
{211}{}{Retired Sergeant Robert Newsom. Before the war, I kept order in the streets of Bakersfield, and now I keep order in Dayglow. I love my job. And I won't let anyone mess around in my territory.}
{212}{}{What do you think of Gustavo?}
{213}{}{He's well-suited for the role of mayor. And ghouls respect him. At least here, in San Ysidro. Though in Old Town, not everyone is as respectful.}
{214}{}{Who runs Old Town?}
{215}{}{John Butler. A former military man. So his head is a mess. He's gathered around him not only ghouls but also super mutants and normies. They're all lookin' for something from him.}
{216}{}{What are relations between Gustavo and Butler like?}
{217}{}{They've had a lot of disagreements lately. But I'm sure it won't break their friendship.}
{218}{}{}
{219}{}{}
{220}{}{Tell me about the area around here.}
{221}{}{San Ysidro and Old Town are the main ghoul settlements. Between them, you've got radioactive ruins and charred parks crawling with rogue scavengers and all kinds of monsters.}
{222}{}{[Next]}
{223}{}{The nukes mostly hit the naval base and the industrial zone, but downtown San Diego took a heavy blow too. Now it's just ruins, high radiation, skeletons everywhere - and military robots patrolling all over. They've been roaming since the alarms went off at the base.}
{224}{}{Tell me how to get to Chula Vista.}
{225}{}{You need to cross the Otay River valley. There's only one surviving bridge, but it's patrolled by robots and booby-trapped. So we either go around or straight through the valley. But there are a lot of horrible creatures in that valley.}
{226}{}{Tell me how to get to Bonita Dam.}
{227}{}{Follow Federal Highway 805 to the sign. Then turn right.}
{228}{}{Tell me how to get to Old Town.}
{229}{}{Going straight through the ruins will be very difficult. It's easier to get on Highway 805 and go to Balboa Park. Watch out for monsters in the park. Go left into the Little Italy area. Then head north.}
{230}{}{What do you think of all those 'rogue' scavengers?}
{231}{}{Mostly, they're just scavengers, picking up scraps from the Old World without even knowing what half of it's for. Then they sell it off to caravans, leaving us ghouls with just the leftovers. But some of them are killers, taking out anyone who crosses their path. Gustavo's trying to drive them out of our ruins, while Butler thinks he can tame them - handing out Set's Seal to the ones who fall in line.}
{232}{}{How do you feel about the super mutants?}
{233}{}{Super mutants? The Master's army broke apart long ago, splintered into scattered groups around the ruins. You'll find plenty nearby - some hostile, some working with us, others just keeping to themselves. Lost souls, all of them.}

{241}{}{We are looking for his squad with Gomer. Have you heard about them?}
{242}{}{I've heard that some super mutants set up camp in Balboa Park. They're not aggressive, rather the opposite. Maybe it's the squad you're looking for.}
{243}{}{Got it. Thanks.}
