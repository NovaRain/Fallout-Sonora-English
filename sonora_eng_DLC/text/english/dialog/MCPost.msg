{100}{}{You see a sentry in front of you.}
{101}{}{One of the Blue Shields.}
{102}{}{I think I'm hallucinating...}

{110}{}{Looking for trouble, fucker?}
{1110}{}{Looking for trouble, bitch?}

{200}{}{(The sentry's head snaps up at the sound of your approach; startled, he fumbles his weapon but grabs it back up quickly.)}
{201}{}{[More]}
{202}{}{What the... Who the fuck are you? What do you want?}
{203}{}{What the... Fucking freak, you can't sneak up on people like that. What do you want?}
{204}{}{Wait, who are you... Hey guys, there's a spy here!}
{205}{}{You shouldn't have done that...}
{206}{}{Who's the spy? Me?}

{210}{}{Good question. What is this place?}
{211}{}{A great place, bitch. Don't you know who the Blue Shields are? We rule all the roads in this area. And this is our base.}
{212}{}{So you're the ones robbing travelers on the highways? Lucky me, I don't have to look for you. I gonna destroy you all.}
{213}{}{You? You couldn't run a tent. A bunch of losers in an old junkyard, that's what you are.}
{214}{}{Shut your filthy mouth, road carrion... (tightens his grip on his weapon with an angry snarl)}
{215}{}{So what?}
{216}{}{Uh oh...}
{217}{}{Wow. You guys seem cool. Any free spots in the gang? I'm thinking of joining.}
{218}{}{Ha, there's no room for roadkill like you. Get out of here while I'm in a good mood.}
{219}{}{Okay, okay, I'm leaving now.}
{220}{}{Take me to your leader. Maybe he'll have a different opinion.}
{221}{}{I decide who to let in. Clear? And you won't pass. Get out of here.}
{222}{}{Let me through, or I'll come in over your body.}
{1222}{}{Let me through, or I'll come in over your body.}
{223}{}{Try it, bitch.}
{224}{}{You seem to only understand brute force. Let's settle this...}
{225}{}{Okay, you're the boss. Just let me leave.}
{226}{}{Take me to your leader. Now.}
{227}{}{Okay, follow me.}
{228}{}{[Follow him]}
{229}{}{What if I meet you halfway? I'll give you 25 caps.}
{230}{}{(takes the caps, then looks around) Okay, follow me.}
{231}{}{[Follow him]}
{232}{}{(He watches you carefully as you search for non-existent caps in your pockets.)}
{233}{}{Uh, there in here somewhere... Honestly...}
{234}{}{Screw it. It's easier to finish you off right here and now...}
{235}{}{We should have started with this right away. Just let me leave.}
{236}{}{Not so fast, bitch. Hand over all your caps - then you can go.}

{240}{}{I'm traveling. Is there room for me here for the night?}
{241}{}{(Lowers his weapon and breaks into an evil grin.) Here's what's up. Do you even know where you are? This is the Blue Shields' base. We hang people like you on road billboards, got it? Now get lost if you value your life.}
{242}{}{How charmingly crude. And just who do you think you are?}
{243}{}{(the grin fades from his face, replaced by a sneer) What are you talking about? Say it again, maybe I heard it wrong?}
{244}{}{I'll say it clearer: you're a piece of shit.}
{245}{}{Oh, sorry! I'm new to these parts. You won't see me again.}
{246}{}{Hehe, roadkill, you've gone too far. Now hand over all your caps.}
{1246}{}{Hehe, dumb bitch, you've gone too far. Now hand over all your caps.}
{247}{}{You won't get anything.}
{248}{}{Of course, of course, here are all my caps please...}
{249}{}{Where am I? Tell me what this place is.}
{250}{}{I'll overlook your attitude this time. Now, show me to your leader.}
{251}{}{Take me to your leader. I need to talk to him.}
{252}{}{(scratching dirty neck in thought) You want to meet Ben? Do you even know where you are?}
{253}{}{I know. I'm in a rotten hole. And right now, I'm gonna cleanse this place of filth.}
{254}{}{Indeed. And where am I?}
{255}{}{I'm here on behalf of the mayor of Casa Grande. Take me to your boss right now.}
{256}{}{[Obey and go back to the desert]}

{300}{}{Are you still here? Looks like you're looking for trouble.}
{301}{}{I need to speak with your leader.}
{302}{}{Still hanging around? I don't know what you're after, but I won't refuse another bottle.}
{303}{}{I can get you some booze if you let me see your boss.}
{304}{}{Screw it. I'm going in.}
{305}{}{Okay, okay, I'm leaving now.}
{306}{}{Let me in.}
{307}{}{I ran into one of your gang in the desert. He said I could talk to Ben.}
{308}{}{Ah, that changes things. Ben is expecting you. Go ahead, but mind your language to avoid provoking anyone.}
{309}{}{Alright.}

{310}{}{Good luck on the trail, brother.}
{1310}{}{Good luck on the trail, sister.}
{311}{}{What do you want, brother?}
{1311}{}{What do you want, sister?}
{312}{}{Fuck off.}
{313}{}{I don't like you. Get out of here, you shit.}
{314}{}{I've been itching to bash your face in.}
{315}{}{Bye.}

{320}{}{How long have you been in the gang?}
{321}{}{Huh? What do you care? Just watch your back.}
{322}{}{Still, it's pretty cool here.}
{323}{}{Whatever...}
{324}{}{Is this how you always greet new people, moron?}
{325}{}{You're lucky Ben let you walk around the base. Just don't push it.}
{326}{}{Why not?}
{327}{}{We don't like strangers nosing around. Plus, there are a lot of traps around the base. Watch your step. Literally.}
{328}{}{Traps? Can you show me where they are?}
{329}{}{They're not just for show, you know? I've said enough.}
{330}{}{Okay. Got it. Bye.}
{331}{}{About the traps. Can you show me the dangerous spots in more detail?}
{332}{}{I'll pay 50 caps. No one needs to know.}
{333}{}{No way. For an ass like you, it'll cost 100 caps.}
{334}{}{That's too expensive.}
{335}{}{Fine. Here's 100 caps.}
{336}{}{I need to know for sure. Ben approved this.}
{337}{}{Look... We've mined the entire perimeter of the outer walls, except for the gate and the wall near the fuel tank. It's especially dangerous on the western side. Sometimes scorpions fall into the traps, so watch your step.}
{338}{}{Great, this is helpful.}
