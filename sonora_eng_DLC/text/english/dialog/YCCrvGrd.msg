{100}{}{You see a Far Go Trader.}
{101}{}{You see one of the caravan guards.}
{102}{}{Quiet! The main thing now is to stay out of those damn muties' sight.}
{103}{}{Whew! Now we can relax.}
{104}{}{Alright, I'm following you. You know how to get out of here without being spotted, right?}
{105}{}{Yeah, good idea. We need to stay low so they don't see us.}
{106}{}{The Far Go Trader caravan is safe.}
{107}{}{What do they think they're doing? If they keep it up I'll beat their faces in!}

{110}{}{Appreciate the save.}
{111}{}{Those mutants would've ground us to dust if not for you.}
{112}{}{Running into you was real luck.}
{113}{}{The way back won't be any easier, though.}
{114}{}{Any chance there's a bar nearby?}

{120}{}{With Rutger gone, who's gonna handle deals with the ghouls?}
{121}{}{Losing Rutger is gonna make the trip back even rougher.}
{122}{}{Now that Rutger's dead, we might not see a single cap.}

{130}{}{After that blast on the island, it's clear - nothing's coming outta here.}
{131}{}{Gustavo's trying to drive us outta town. The guy's nuts!}
{132}{}{Butler made it to the naval base. We're about to be swimming in caps!}
{133}{}{}
{134}{}{Ghouls are scurrying around like ants after a napalm hit. Never seen anything like it - good news for our wallets, though.}
