{100}{}{You see a Follower of Fire.}
{101}{}{You see one of the Followers. He whispers to himself, either a prayer or some kind of nonsense.}

{200}{}{Greetings, stranger.}
{1200}{}{Greetings, outlander.}
{201}{}{Greetings, brother.}
{1201}{}{Greetings, sister.}
{202}{}{Goodbye.}
{203}{}{May the Holy Fire enlighten you.}
{204}{}{Uh, yeah, sure.}

{210}{}{How did you become a Follower?}
{211}{}{I was as lost and worthless as any creature in the wasteland, focused solely on survival and oblivious to the Holy Fire. After hitting rock bottom and facing relentless persecution, I yearned for solace. Then one day, I stumbled upon this temple. Here, I discovered shelter and a new purpose in life.}
{212}{}{What has faith given you?}
{213}{}{The Church cares about its followers. We receive medical care, education, and, of course, protection from enemies.}
{214}{}{What about others? Those who don't belong to the church?}
{215}{}{Our resources are limited when it comes to outsiders, so we must be cautious when selecting our friends.}
{216}{}{What are you doing in the cathedral?}
{217}{}{I study our doctrine and pray to the Holy Fire. But when I am ready, a great journey to other lands awaits me. I will preach the teachings of the Holy Fire so that our faith will be strengthened in those distant, fallen lands.}
{218}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{219}{}{We are all brothers here. But our guide is Aaron, Lord of Phoenix. He is in the throne room on the top floor of the Cathedral.}
{220}{}{I've heard rumours that one of the monks has infiltrated the Red Cardinals. What do you know about this?}
{221}{}{It's possible I suppose. We are ready to carry the Word of the Holy Fire even to the most depraved souls.}
{222}{}{Do you have any idea who this... 'agent', could be?}
{223}{}{What? You think I'd just give up his name? I don't even know him, and I wouldn't tell you if I did. But all the "agent" correspondence is kept by the radio operator. Only a few are allowed to have access to such information. Are *you* one of them?}
{224}{}{Got it. Thank you.}
{225}{}{Orris has almost sniffed out who the mole is! If you don't help, your brother might die.}
{226}{}{I don't want to be involved with this. Sorry.}
{227}{}{I see...}
{228}{}{Is it that bad? Then warn Murphy that Orris is on to him. He'll know what to do.}
{229}{}{So it's Murphy? Thanks, that's all I needed.}
