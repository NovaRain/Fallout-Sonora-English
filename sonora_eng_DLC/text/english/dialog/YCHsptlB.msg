{101}{}{You see a regular ghoul.}
{102}{}{Z-z-z...}

{110}{}{Ugh...}
{111}{}{Ah...}
{112}{}{Pain...}
{113}{}{Still hurts...}

{200}{}{Hey, human, give me a hand! Got myself trapped in a cave-in and busted a few bones. These old ruins are falling apart...}
{200}{}{Hey, buddy, give me a hand! Got myself trapped in a cave-in and busted a few bones. These old ruins are falling apart...}
{202}{}{Damn! Hold still, I'll give you hand!}
{203}{}{Dream on. I don't want to dirty my hands on a freak like you.}
{204}{}{I'm not going to help you. I'll just take your stuff and leave you to die.}
{205}{}{Oh no! No! Nooo...}
{206}{}{See you in the afterlife. Maybe.}
{207}{}{I'm just kidding, old man! Hold on, I'll fix you up.}
{208}{}{I never expected a human to help me, especially in the heart of these radioactive ruins. Thank you, friend.}
{209}{}{You're welcome. By the way, what were you doing here?}
{210}{}{Don't forget to tell your ghoul friends about my help. How did you end up here, anyway?}
{211}{}{Exploring the ruins, obviously. But the floors here are very fragile. Tread carefully, friend. Oh, and that's not the only danger.. From the window, I saw some creature. Huge, terrifying, with claws like sabers. Don't let it catch you. Now, good luck. I'll try to hobble to the nearest camp.}
{212}{}{Thanks for the warning. Goodbye.}
{213}{}{Don't think I remember your face. We didn't run into each other in Necropolis, did we? Odd. But anyway - thanks, friend. Couldn't have even made it through the front door without you.}
