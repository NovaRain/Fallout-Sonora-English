{100}{}{You see Diego's woman.}
{101}{}{You see one of Don Diego's wives.}

{110}{}{What makes you think you can just walk in here?}  
{111}{}{There's no room for you here.}  
{112}{}{If my husband finds out, we're all in trouble.}  
{113}{}{You better get out of here, now.}  
{114}{}{Diego won't like you being around.}  
{115}{}{If you've got business with Diego, go deal with him directly.}  
  
{1110}{}{Don't even think about joining our circle.}  
{1111}{}{Sweetheart, this spot's already taken.}  
{1112}{}{Thinking about becoming part of the family?}  
{1113}{}{You should leave while you still can.}  
{1114}{}{We don't need any new competition.}  
{1115}{}{Diego is ours. Don't even think about sharing his bed.}  
  
{120}{}{We don't know what to do now.}  
{121}{}{Diego was the one who kept us safe.}  
{122}{}{Without my husband, everything's falling apart.}  
{123}{}{Since Diego's death, no one's been able to keep control.}  
{124}{}{Oh, Diego... who took you from us?}
