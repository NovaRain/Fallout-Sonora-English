{100}{}{You see Bruce.}
{101}{}{You see a man in a business suit. His calm gaze expresses indifference to human life.}
{102}{}{This is Power Armor, right? Impressive. But talking through it won't work.}
{103}{}{Well, well, another junkie from the street. Come back when you've cleaned yourself up.}

#Introductory threads
{200}{}{Welcome. I'm Bruce Turner and this is the Mercenary Guild. Do you need some experienced hands for security, or are you looking to put or collect a bounty on someone' head?}
{201}{}{Perhaps.}
{202}{}{...}

{210}{}{Damn, what the hell happened to your skin?}
{211}{}{Just a sprinkle of virus and a dash of radiation. No big deal.}
{212}{}{Huh. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't be cracking jokes.}
{213}{}{You get used to it, smoothskin.}
{214}{}{In my shoes, you'd be dead already.}
{215}{}{Think it's funny, smoothie?}
{216}{}{(raises an eyebrow) No. Not at all, big guy.}
{217}{}{Good.}
{218}{}{Next time, I might take it personally.}

{220}{}{Good day, sir. Glad we could meet. Is someone bothering you?}
{1220}{}{Good day, ma'am. Glad we could meet. Is someone bothering you?}
{221}{}{Why are you suddenly so polite?}
{222}{}{Clearly, you've earned some proper treatment... sir.}
{1222}{}{Clearly, you've earned some proper treatment... ma'am.}
{223}{}{Well, well, here's our notorious visiting peasant. You've been getting a little too comfortable in this city. Think you're untouchable?}
{224}{}{City folk are so mean and petty. Us peasant folk? Much friendlier.}
{225}{}{You should've stayed in your desert village. Time to return your corpse to the sands...}
{226}{}{What are you...}
{227}{}{I'll defend myself.}
{228}{}{I'm just surviving. You're in no place to judge me.}
{229}{}{Oh no. The city pays me for bringing in criminals. And you're on the list. Boys... (signals)}
{230}{}{Don't do this, Bruce...}
{231}{}{I'll defend myself.}
{232}{}{I don't want to fight. Let's work something out?}
{233}{}{Everyone's scraping by. You're not exactly making an honest living either, are you?}
{234}{}{Hmph. Fair enough. I don't know who to trust. But I do know this - if you don't leave the city, you'll be hanging from a lamp post. Got it?}
{235}{}{Got it.}
{236}{}{Go to hell, Bruce. You and your crooked crew.}
{237}{}{Good to hear.}
{238}{}{Flattery doesn't suit a merc boss. But I'll take it.}

{240}{}{Don't move. First, I want to know what happened between you and the Followers of Fire.}
{241}{}{That's between them and me. It doesn't concern you.}
{242}{}{Oh no. This is the Mercenary Guild, not a brothel. I've worked with the Followers of Fire for years, transporting slaves and convicts across the desert. And now you come along and block a hell of a lot of contracts for me. What gives?}
{243}{}{I told you, it's between them and me. Personal.}
{244}{}{So, are we talking about a grudge, or revenge or something? Got it. But you're lucky the Followers haven't paid for your head yet. If that changes, I promise, your head will be on my table.}
{245}{}{Not feeling so welcome here. It's better if I leave.}
{246}{}{I doubt it's gonna come to that, Bruce. See you.}

{247}{}{Adios, banditos.}
{248}{}{[give him the middle finger]}
{249}{}{Whatever you say, you're the 'boss'.}
{250}{}{What a surprise. We usually chase after the criminals, not the other way around.}
{251}{}{But I'm not a criminal.}
{252}{}{Who you calling a criminal?}
{253}{}{You didn't know that Flagstaff has declared you their 'most wanted'? You're lucky they haven't offered a reward for you yet. However, now I know you and where to find you. Keep that in mind and be cool.}
{254}{}{No problem, sheriff.}
{255}{}{I'm not the sheriff, idiot. But if it comes down to it, I'll be worse than any sheriff.}
{1255}{}{I'm not the sheriff, idiot. But if it comes down to it I'll be worse than any sheriff.}
{256}{}{Yeah, I believe it.}
{257}{}{You didn't pick up on my sarcastic tone. I'll be back when you cool down, 'sheriff'.}
{258}{}{And I know you, and where to find you. Keep *that* in mind.}
{259}{}{(slowly places his hand on his machine gun, looking into your eyes) Get out of my office.}

{260}{}{Welcome... Stop. Show me your neck. Those are marks from a slave collar. It's pretty strange for a runaway slave to come here. What do you want, *slave*?}
{261}{}{Don't call me that. Or you'll regret it.}
{262}{}{You don't seem to understand your precarious position. Guys... (gives a sign)}
{263}{}{Not in the face...}
{264}{}{Step up slavers, time to die...}
{265}{}{I want my freedom back. The Tinsmiths treated me badly.}
{266}{}{Hmm. Tinsmiths won't want to buy a runaway slave again at the same price. You're putting me in an awkward position. Well, I'm ready to buy your rights and sign your freedom. But it'll cost 1000 caps. I doubt you have that amount.}
{267}{}{I'll come up with it.}
{268}{}{Then I have no choice... I'll just kill you.}
{269}{}{Hmm. Okay, agreed. I'm waiting for 1000 caps.}

{270}{}{(squints at your face) Hmm. I recently got a tip about one of the Blue Shields. And you are suspiciously close to his description.}
{271}{}{It's a coincidence. Do you have *any* evidence?}
{272}{}{No. But I'll keep an eye on you.}
{273}{}{Alright then.}
{274}{}{Keep an eye on your own business.}
{275}{}{The Blue Shields made me a mediator in their negotiations.}
{276}{}{Hmph. Very interesting. If that's true, you might be a decent person. Well, while you're in this city, take care of yourself. The locals aren't fond of highwaymen.}
{277}{}{They have a lot of enemies, that's for sure.}
{278}{}{You're a little too nosey for your own good, Bruce. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to put you down...}

{280}{}{This is road armor. Where did you get it from?}
{281}{}{Battle trophy.}
{282}{}{Hmm. Okay, I can believe it. But it's better not to flash it in this city. Many here have heard about the highwaymen and may mistake you for one of them.}
{283}{}{Thanks for the warning.}
{284}{}{I'm not worried about the locals.}
{285}{}{A gift from a good friend.}
{286}{}{You have dangerous friends. I recommend putting this away while you're in town. Locals have heard a lot about highwaymen. You might accidentally catch a bullet in the back.}

{290}{}{Well, well, another dredge of the desert. They say you stirred up a lot of trouble in Casa Grande. Is this true?}
{1290}{}{Well, well, another dredge of the desert. They say you stirred up a lot of trouble in Casa Grande. Is this true?}
{291}{}{What are you talking about? I get on fine with people there.}
{292}{}{Don't lie to me, buddy. My sources are rarely wrong.}
{1292}{}{Don't lie to me, honey. My sources are rarely wrong.}
{293}{}{What do you care?}
{294}{}{Yeah, I had a little trouble there. They had it coming though.}
{295}{}{(raises one eyebrow) An honest confession? This makes things easier.}
{296}{}{What's the problem?}
{297}{}{You're lucky the locals there haven't put a price on your head yet. But keep in mind, that could change at any time.}
{298}{}{Hmph. I'll keep a low profile.}
{299}{}{I highly doubt it.}

# Basic dialogue
{300}{}{Welcome. How can I help you?}
{301}{}{I don't recommend making any sudden movements. What do you need?}
{302}{}{I here on behalf of Chuck from the Blue Shields.}
{303}{}{Okay, wait a minute... Yes, he's some petty thief for whom the mayor of Casa Grande has posted a bounty. You here to pay for it? Or collect? The bounty is 250 caps.}
{304}{}{Pay. Here's the caps.}
{305}{}{This criminal is now officially off our list. I'll also send this out to Casa Grande.}
{306}{}{Thanks.}
{307}{}{I can't afford it. Goodbye.}
{308}{}{}
{309}{}{See you later.}

# Slave title
{310}{}{I want to buy my freedom from slavery.}
{311}{}{We've already discussed this. Do you have 1000 caps?}
{312}{}{No.}
{313}{}{Then the question is closed.}
{314}{}{Damn...}
{315}{}{Here they are.}
{316}{}{To be honest, I'm surprised. I doubt these caps were obtained honestly, but I don't want to know.}
{317}{}{And my freedom?}
{318}{}{This will take a while...}
{319}{}{I'll wait...}
{320}{}{Done. You are now officially free. Congratulations. Cherish your second chance.}
{1320}{}{Done. You are now officially free. Congratulations. Cherish your second chance.}
{321}{}{Definitely. Goodbye.}
{322}{}{Hey, it's not like you actually freed me. I was always free. Just needed off your stupid list.}

# Quest of the Cardinals
{323}{}{You'll regret this.}
{324}{}{Bruce, let the guy go. He's my old friend. You won't refuse my request, will you?}
{325}{}{You're a respected man around town, so I'll do as you ask. But be careful not to get into trouble with these Cardinals. It's easy to sully your reputation workin' with them.}
{326}{}{I'll figure it out. Thanks for your understanding, Bruce.}
{327}{}{He's an old friend of mine. And he is not to blame for anything. Let him go.}
{328}{}{I don't know you from shit, and your word holds no sway in this city. If you interfere with my work, you'll end up in the same cell for aiding and abetting.}
{329}{}{Yeesh, alright.}
{330}{}{I know you apprehended a Red Cardinal.}
{331}{}{Yeah, he's sittin' in jail, thinking about his future. But how do YOU know this? No one except the capture team knew this.}
{332}{}{I have my sources. What's he accused of?}
{333}{}{It's not something that needs public attention. Our client wanted the deal stopped, but that's all I know.}
{334}{}{I see. Happy hunting.}
{335}{}{I need to see him. I'll pay 10 caps if you let me.}
{336}{}{Okay. You have ten minutes.}
{337}{}{Here are the caps.}
{338}{}{Not now.}
{339}{}{How much did you get paid to capture him? I'll pay more for his release.}
{340}{}{Hmm. It was a small matter to start with. I'll release him on bail of 100 caps.}

{341}{}{Okay. Here's 100 caps.}
{342}{}{That's too much. He's not worth it.}
{343}{}{Can I just talk to him? I'll pay 10 caps for it.}
{344}{}{Alright, he's free to go. He'll probably get nabbed again though, eventually. You know these Cardinals, right? Complete thugs and hooligans. They're a threat to society.}
{345}{}{I can't deny that.}
{346}{}{The Church of the Holy Fire is concerned about what happened. This guy was part of our intelligence service. Let him go. Right now.}
{347}{}{That's what I thought. I figured this case smelled fishy. Okay, I don't want any problems with the church. Let him go. But we're not responsible for him anymore. It's all on you.}
{348}{}{Thanks for your understanding, Bruce.}
{349}{}{Okay.}

# Questions about slaves
{350}{}{Tell me what you do here.}
{351}{}{This is the Mercenary Guild. We provide strong folk for dangerous tasks. Usually, that's security or hunting down criminals. Need something like that?}
{352}{}{No, nothing like that.}
{353}{}{Well, if you do, I'll be glad to help. For a fee, of course.}
{354}{}{Of course.}

{360}{}{Do you also trade in slaves?}
{361}{}{Slave contracts? Not many can afford to pay for that.}
{362}{}{Who, for example?}
{363}{}{Main clients are the Flagstaff colony and the Tinsmiths. But I wouldn't call them slaves. Usually, they're criminals serving sentences. Why do you ask?}
{364}{}{Uh, just curious.}
{365}{}{Simple curiosity raises suspicions. I hope you understand what that means.}
{366}{}{Uh, I guess so.}
{367}{}{I'm thinking about buying a couple of slaves.}
{368}{}{That's not happening. We won't give you a single prisoner.}
{369}{}{Then forget it.}
{370}{}{I'm looking for slaves originally from Villa.}
{371}{}{Villa... That doesn't ring a bell.}
{372}{}{I'm looking for slaves from Villa. They were brought here from Flagstaff.}
{373}{}{Villa... That doesn't mean anything to me. If these slaves were from Flagstaff, finding them won't be easy.}
{374}{}{I see. Sorry to trouble you.}
{375}{}{Alright, I'll have to figure it out on my own again. Goodbye.}
{376}{}{I'll pay 100 caps for the information.}
{377}{}{Sounds reasonable. I can check recent shipment invoices and contact our agents. Pay up front though.}
{378}{}{Here's the caps. I'll wait.}
{379}{}{No need, I'll just find out myself.}
{380}{}{Okay, checked the invoices... Several slaves originally from Villa ended up in the Flagstaff colony. They were bought by fire worshippers and transported to their Cathedral. Must've been damn good slaves to be worth the journey. What happened to them after that is known only to the monks.}
{381}{}{Thanks, Bruce. It's time to pay a visit to the Cathedral of Fire.}
{382}{}{Hmph. I could've figured that out on my own.}
{1382}{}{Hmph. I could've figured that out without you.}
{383}{}{Okay, checked the invoices... Several slaves originally from Villa ended up in the Flagstaff colony. They were bought by fire worshippers and transported to Two-Sun. Must've been damn good slaves to be worth the journey.}
{384}{}{Thanks, Bruce. It's time to pay a visit to Two-Sun. I hope there are caravans going there.}
{385}{}{You know, Bruce, you weren't that big of a help help. Goodbye.}
{386}{}{I'll come back later. I don't have that many caps on me right now.}

# Eliminating George Crook
{390}{}{There's a troublemaker that needs dealing with. Name's George Crook.}
{391}{}{The same Commander Crook who took down the western tribe? Why do you want him gone?}
{392}{}{I'm just representing the client.}
{393}{}{Got it. That old war dog's made plenty of enemies in town. Hell, some of my best guys jumped ship to his crew. Now Crook's just blowing caps, bored out of his mind. I don't know how the casino puts up with his drunken antics.}
{394}{}{So, will you take the job?}
{395}{}{Well, I didn't say that... but for 500 caps, the world can forget he ever existed.}
{396}{}{I'll need to think on it. It's a big task, you understand.}
{397}{}{Deal. Here's the caps. And remember, this conversation never happened.}
{398}{}{Don't worry, we'll handle everything.}
{399}{}{I'm counting on you guys.}

# Headhunting
{400}{}{I'm interested in tracking down criminals. Who's wanted, and how much do they pay?}
{401}{}{(sigh) Another bounty hunter...}
{1401}{}{A bounty hunter in a lace apron? Where are we headed...}
{402}{}{Something wrong?}
{1402}{}{Ahem. Need I remind you your bodyguard is a woman?}
{403}{}{Ah, wait a minute, you're the one the whole city's buzzing about from those arena fights? That changes things.}
{404}{}{I can handle myself, no doubt about it.}
{405}{}{}
{406}{}{}
{407}{}{Do you even have a rifle? This is dangerous work, no place for beginners. But if you want to risk your neck, it's up to you.}
{408}{}{I can handle it.}
{409}{}{There's a notice board outside. It has the latest bounties. The system is simple. You find the criminal according to the description, bring their head to me, and receive your reward. Any questions? Then go ahead. Good luck.}
{410}{}{See you later, Bruce Turner.}
{411}{}{About the notice board outside...}
{412}{}{Here to claim one of the bounties?}
{413}{}{No. Not yet.}
{414}{}{I thought so. Come back when you've at least caught someone.}
{415}{}{Okay.}
{416}{}{I'm a ranger. I'm interested in work.}
{417}{}{Rangers usually don't like our agency. Strange that you're interested.}
{418}{}{I'm a lone ranger.}
{419}{}{Okay...}
{420}{}{Yep. I want to claim the bounty on Hernando Aviles.}
{421}{}{Ah, so our old friend Hernando is dead. He won't be makin' any more jokes about me! Let's see his head.}
{422}{}{Here's the head.}
{423}{}{Bitch, he made a lot of noise. Good to hear his big mouth will never make a sound again. Where's his head?}
{424}{}{Yes. I'm here to claim the bounty Eydie Gorme}
{425}{}{Eh, she was once a beauty and performed in the casino. Strange fate. I don't understand why she lost her mind. Where is that pretty head?}
{426}{}{Yes. I'm here to claim the bounty on Chucho Navarro.}
{427}{}{Hernando Aviles is dead. But I couldn't take his head.}
{428}{}{Chucho Navarro is dead. But I was unable to bring his head.}
{429}{}{Eydie Gorme is dead. Unfortunately, I left her head somewhere out in the wasteland.}
{430}{}{No head, no reward. But I'm glad to hear this news. Until a refutation is received, we'll assume that you're telling the truth.}
{431}{}{Uh, okay.}
{432}{}{I won't get any caps? This is very bad.}
{433}{}{Great job. Here's your 500 caps. I hope you're not going to quit bounty huntin'. We need people like you.}
{434}{}{I'll think about it.}
{435}{}{I don't know, this activity is too dangerous.}

{436}{}{Nice work. Here's the 500 caps. Lookin' forward to seeing you bring in another head.}


{440}{}{Wait a second... so that was the last boss of Los Panchos? Damn, that gang's finally finished. Just imagine how fast word's gonna spread through Phoenix. The townsfolk are gonna celebrate like it's a holiday.}
{441}{}{For sure. But aren't there other bosses?}
{442}{}{Those three ran the biggest and deadliest clans in Los Panchos. The rest? They're not much of a threat. Without their bosses, the whole empire's gonna crumble, and the regular raiders will be easy pickings. I'd bet the clans are already at each other's throats, fighting over who gets what in the power vacuum.}
{443}{}{This is a little weird. But it's even stranger that the bosses had the same mark as you and your mercenaries.}
{444}{}{Hmm. Someday it had to be revealed... We embellished their legend a little. In fact, these three worked as mercenaries in our guild. They learned a lot here. But having felt the power and control over people, they stopped being interested in honest work.}
{445}{}{You should have warned about this.}
{446}{}{These people are a disgrace to the guild. We cannot allow our reputation to suffer because of them.}
{447}{}{That makes sense.}
{448}{}{Actually, I don't care.}
{449}{}{You've had enough of completed contracts. For now, relax and have fun. And I'll think about what other job you can leave.}
{450}{}{More work? Great, looking forward to it.}
{451}{}{I doubt I'll want to work for you after hearing this. Goodbye, Bruce.}
{452}{}{Well, that's good news I suppose.}
{453}{}{I could care less, as long as I get the caps.}
{454}{}{Right. For now, relax and celebrate a bit. Meanwhile I'll see if I can come up with any other jobs for you.}
{455}{}{More work? Great, looking forward to it. See you later.}
{456}{}{I've earned enough caps to get out of this business. Goodbye, Bruce.}
{457}{}{Any new jobs for me?}

{460}{}{You're just in time. I was already thinking of sending for you. There is a new target. And this time I'm paying a premium price.}
{461}{}{Hmph. I imagine whoever it is, won't be easy, especially if you're paying more. What did he do wrong?}
{462}{}{(shows portrait) This is Gil McCord. Known as one of the best shooters and trackers around. He knows his business well and can handle any trouble. He's got to be taken out.}
{463}{}{Gil McCord... This doesn't add up. Feels like you're keeping something from me. Why would mercs be hunting one of their own?}
{464}{}{(sigh) Alright, I might've left out a few details about those bounties. The truth is, the Los Panchos bosses... they were mercs with the Guild once. Learned a lot from us, which is how they managed to carve out their turf outside the city.}
{465}{}{And Gil McCord?}
{466}{}{He was their go-between and a spy. We found that out after clearing the Los Panchos bases. Turns out Gil was too greedy and paranoid, playing both sides to keep a backup plan in case things went south.}
{467}{}{You should've told me the truth about the gang from the beginning.}
{468}{}{Gil is a disgrace to the guild. We cannot allow our reputation to suffer because of him.}
{469}{}{Okay, whatever. I guess it's history now.}
{470}{}{I get it.}
{471}{}{Kill Gil McCord and bring back his head.}
{472}{}{I'll do it. You can count on me.}
{473}{}{I don't think I'll be working for you anymore after hearing this. Goodbye, Bruce.}

{474}{}{I've done your dirty work. Here's his head.}
{1474}{}{I've done your dirty work. Here's his head.}
{475}{}{(nods sadly) Gil McCord. You were one of us. And this is what greed has brought you to. His story will serve as an example to others. You are due 750 caps, as we agreed. I really hope this amount doesn't turn your head like it turned Gil's. And in the future, try not to talk about our little secret.}
{476}{}{No problem, boss. Goodbye.}
{477}{}{After everything you've seen? I won't even take a step here.}

{480}{}{About Gil McCord.}
{481}{}{Got any news?}
{482}{}{None yet.}
{483}{}{Do you have any idea where he might be?}
{484}{}{I doubt he's still in town. Plus, our agents spotted someone matching his description heading south with a caravan. Not many settlements down that way, so that's where you should start looking.}
{485}{}{So he could be anywhere. I'd better stop wasting time then.}
{486}{}{Can I get something for the trip?}
{487}{}{This job is already going to be paying a premium price.}
{488}{}{Alright.}
{489}{}{I think I'm gonna need extra travel expenses and ammo.}
{490}{}{But how will I find this guy?}

{491}{}{For this job, alright. Here's 100 caps for travel expenses. What kind of ammo will you need?}
{492}{}{10mm}
{493}{}{.44 cal}
{494}{}{.50 cal}
{495}{}{5mm}
{496}{}{Are there any 40mm shells for a grenade launcher?}
{497}{}{I only use energy weapons.}
{498}{}{Now go track down that bastard. And don't come back without his head, got it?}
{499}{}{Roger that, boss.}
{1499}{}{Got it, boss.}

{500}{}{How much can you trust your people? What are their skills?}
{501}{}{My people undergo regular training. They know their worth. And I know who is better suited for this or that job. Don't worry, they are professionals in their field.}
{502}{}{In the murder business?}
{503}{}{Exactly. Real killers. Cool and precise.}
{504}{}{Sounds cool. How can I become a real KILLER? Can I take your training to too?}
{505}{}{Uh, too much talk of killing. Let's change the subject, okay?}
{506}{}{Look, this is a pricey operation. And you're not in the guild yet. With all the costs, it's gonna run you 50,000 caps. But once you're trained up, you'll be making good money taking out all kinds of scum.}
{507}{}{I don't have that kind of money! And I seriously doubt I could earn them back, even with your *training*. Goodbye.}
{508}{}{I'm fine with that.}
{509}{}{Caps on the table and we can begin.}
{510}{}{Not now, I need to go get it.}
{511}{}{[Silently hand over the caps]}
{512}{}{You're one tough, son of a bitch. You'll make a great bounty hunter.}
{1512}{}{You're one tough bitch. You'll make a great bounty hunter.}
{513}{}{You have acquired the Slayer perk.}
{514}{}{Even though you're already in the guild, you'll still have to cover the costs. It's not cheap - 35,000 caps.}
{515}{}{After that last job, it's time you start training the new recruits yourself. But for you, I'll make an exception and cover the costs entirely.}
{516}{}{[Silently follow Bruce's instructions]}
{517}{}{You're not ready to think about such things. Grow up a little.}
{518}{}{Okay.}
