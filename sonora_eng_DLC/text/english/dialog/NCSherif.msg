{100}{}{You see Frank.}
{101}{}{You see a grim looking man in combat gear.}
{102}{}{}
{103}{}{}
{104}{}{}
{105}{}{Hostile presence in town! Everyone, find cover!}

{200}{}{Is something wrong?}
{201}{}{No. Should there be?}
{202}{}{I'm not going to waste much time on you. Can you read? Then study and remember the rules by the main gate. They're simple.}
{203}{}{Ah, the rules... But I just arrived in town. I need to speak with someone.}
{1203}{}{Ah, the rules... But I just arrived in town. I need to speak with someone.}
{204}{}{Good to see you, brother! Congrats on the promotion.}
{1204}{}{Good to see you, sister! Congrats on the promotion.}
{205}{}{You're with the Brotherhood too?}
{206}{}{That's right. The Brotherhood keeps this town in check. Our patrols stop by regularly. It's a calm and safe place. Some of our fighters even come here for rest and recovery. Conditions on the ship, as you know, aren't exactly pleasant.}
{207}{}{Right. You don't mind if I stick around? Great.}
{208}{}{(blow Frank a sarcastic kiss)}
{209}{}{What? Oh, ha ha. Funny. Listen, I just want you to stay out of trouble. Keep it quiet and your gun holstered. It's simple.}

{210}{}{Listening.}
{211}{}{I'm all ears.}
{2211}{}{Just gimme a reason, and the desert roaches will feast on your filthy mutated body.}
{212}{}{You're still here?}
{213}{}{I won't bother you anymore. Goodbye.}
{214}{}{You're a real ass.}
{215}{}{But we're friends, right?}
{216}{}{Bye.}
{217}{}{I've heard about you. You respect our rules and don't cause trouble. That's enough for me. I think we'll get along.}
{2217}{}{I've heard about you. You respect our rules and don't cause trouble. That's enough for me. Though I hate mutants. Just know that under different circumstances, I'd draw my gun without hesitation.}
{218}{}{No doubt.}
{219}{}{It's gonna be hard for you to make it onto my 'amigos' list. Keep that in mind.}

{220}{}{They say people are disappearing from the plantations, and you're doing nothing about it.}
{221}{}{That's a serious accusation.}
{222}{}{That's what people are saying...}
{223}{}{Remember, outsider, I don't like panic or rumor-mongering in my town. Don't want trouble? Then don't make things worse. Simple as that.}
{224}{}{Yeah, I don't want any trouble.}
{225}{}{The same goes for you. Remember, justice catches up to everyone eventually.}
{226}{}{Seems I should thank you for everything you've done for us.}
{2226}{}{Even though you're a mutant, I have to say thanks for everything you've done for us.}

{230}{}{Isn't open carry prohibited here?}
{231}{}{It is. And you should respect our laws.}
{232}{}{But why are YOU carrying a weapon?}
{233}{}{I'm the one who sets the rules.}
{234}{}{I see. Sorry for the stupid question. I gotta go.}
{235}{}{Right. It's convenient that way...}
{236}{}{I don't like you. You show up uninvited and question our rules. But I'll give you a choice.}
{237}{}{And what choice is that?}
{238}{}{Either you follow the rules and stop bothering everyone, or you hit the road. Think carefully.}
{239}{}{The only one bothering everyone here is you. And I'll make sure to ruin your shift.}
{240}{}{Fine. I'll make a choice. The right one.}
{241}{}{It's prohibited. The peasants need to know who's in charge. Otherwise, there'll be chaos. Everyone, including you, has to follow this rule.}
{242}{}{Of course.}

{243}{}{Stop! (raises his rifle) Put away your weapon. Open carry is prohibited here.}
{244}{}{Sorry, sheriff. I'm not familiar with the local rules.}
{245}{}{I don't care about your rules.}
{246}{}{Heh! [Comply]}
{247}{}{Nope! [Continue waving weapon at him]}
{248}{}{Is that so? Fine. THIS TIME I'll overlook this. Only out of respect for your reputation.}
{249}{}{Wise decision, Sheriff.}
{250}{}{Is there a problem? Why are you disturbing the peace?}
{251}{}{Just couldn't sleep. Wanted to breathe in the night air.}
{252}{}{Don't give me that. During curfew, everyone should be in their homes. You've got two minutes to get back to bed and stay there until 6 AM.}
{253}{}{Will do, sir. No problem...}
{254}{}{Is there a problem?}
{255}{}{No, none at all.}
{256}{}{I'm on patrol. Unless you have a good reason, it's best not to be out at this hour. I might mistake you for a thief or some desert beast.}
{257}{}{Sorry, I'll leave soon.}
{258}{}{You know the rules. The main one is not to piss me off.}
{259}{}{Sorry, I'll leave soon.}
{260}{}{You again. We've already discussed what not to do at night. So what's the problem?}
{261}{}{Uh, just insomnia, sir. Sorry...}
{262}{}{Alright, I tried to be nice. Now it's time to teach you a lesson. You'll spend ten hours in the cell thinking about your behavior. Move it. And forget about running.}
{263}{}{Okay, sir, I not gonna run...}
{264}{}{Bite me!}
{265}{}{I'm fed up with this!}
{266}{}{Oh boy...}
{267}{}{Bite me!}

{270}{}{So we meet at last, scumbag. Good, I won't have to hunt you down. Thought you could just slip away from the Brotherhood?}
{1270}{}{So we meet at last, you scum. Good, I won't have to hunt you down. Thought you could just slip away from the Brotherhood?}
{271}{}{Of course. And you're no match for me.}
{272}{}{No one escapes the Brotherhood. You're a criminal. My duty is to bring you to justice. Right here and now. Got any last words? No? Good, you don't deserve them...}
{273}{}{Oops...}
{274}{}{I have no idea what you're talking about. You must have mistaken me for someone else...}
{275}{}{You've got the wrong person. I don't know shit about a Brotherhood.}
{276}{}{Hmm, maybe. But you fit the description too well. Alright, sorry. But I've got my eye on you.}
{277}{}{Phew, that was close...}

{280}{}{Can you tell me about your town?}
{281}{}{Here's what you need to know about the town, outsider. Follow the rules and don't bother the locals. You'll fit in if you want to. But honestly, it's best to stick to the mayor and the Followers, and avoid everyone else.}
{1281}{}{Here's what you need to know about the town, outsider. Follow the rules and don't bother the locals. You'll fit in if you want to. But honestly, it's best to stick to the mayor and the Followers, and avoid everyone else.}
{282}{}{Got it.}
{283}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{284}{}{The town is run by Mayor Alvaro. He's down the street in the big building with arches.}
{285}{}{Got it.}
{286}{}{What do you do?}
{287}{}{I'm the town sheriff. I'm responsible for security and law enforcement.}
{288}{}{I see. Good luck with your duties.}
{289}{}{So, how's the security here?}
{290}{}{Everything's safe and secure.}
{291}{}{You sure about that?}
{292}{}{I'll take your word for it.}
{293}{}{Law. Security. Boring. I want to fight!}
{294}{}{Hmm... There's one cursed place you should avoid. I'm warning you now, so I don't have to drag you out later.}
{295}{}{Tell me.}
{296}{}{The concrete plant outside of town and the quarry next to it. The plant was shut down after people started disappearing there. Rumors abound, but no one knows what really happened.}
{297}{}{Got it. Thanks for the warning.}

#El Gigante
{300}{}{About the concrete plant.}
{301}{}{Yeah?}
{302}{}{Actually, I'd rather not talk about that creepy place. I have other questons.}
{303}{}{I'll solve the problem for 300 caps.}
{304}{}{I've heard that from past mercenaries. If you value your life, don't go near the plant.}
{305}{}{I'm still going. Take me to the concrete plant right now.}
{306}{}{Alright, I'll heed your advice.}
{307}{}{There was a monster at the plant. I managed to take it down. It was one, tough, bastard...}
{308}{}{...Well, I'll be damned! A Deathclaw? Here? Those creatures sure get around.}
{309}{}{It won't be a threat to anyone anymore.}
{310}{}{Excellent job. The whole town owes you. So here's a reward straight from the town treasury.}
{311}{}{Thanks.}
{312}{}{How do you know about Deathclaws?}
{313}{}{Heard about them during training, but never encountered one. Veterans say they live in the mountains to the west, where few dare to tread.}
{314}{}{Interesting.}
{315}{}{I know of only one other time a Deathclaw got into a town and stirred up a bunch of trouble. It was in the Boneyard. A female set up in an abandoned basement and even laid eggs. But one brave merc found them and took them out, destroying the eggs. Just imagine if those things had hatched.}
{316}{}{Terrifying.}
{317}{}{Well, a fine job, warrior. You should join our ranks.}
{318}{}{Maybe...maybe... I had some other quesitons though.}
{319}{}{You mentioned training. Where was that?}
{320}{}{I'm a paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel. Our local base is in Puerto Penasco, with the main headquarters far off in California. That's where I trained before volunteering for this desert mission.}
{321}{}{Wow. Good to know.}
{322}{}{I want to help with this problem. Can you show me the place?}

#Pinky
{330}{}{I've come across Pinky. They say you want him dead.}
{331}{}{Chipo should have his tongue shortened for saying that. I'm not bloodthirsty. But I have a mission - to keep the town safe. For now, there's no formal reason to exterminate the pig rat. But if he gives me just one reason, he'll start him on his big rat journey to the skies.}
{332}{}{Why do you dislike him so much?}
{333}{}{He's harmless now, just a young one. But what happens when he grows up and smells blood? Pig rats are aggressive predators. There's no place for them among people.}
{334}{}{Hmm.}
{335}{}{Your stance is clear. Crystal clear.}
{336}{}{And why do you care about the pig rat? Obviously, just curiosity. Well, I've got an offer for you. I'll pay you 30 caps if you take care of that beast. What do you say?}
{337}{}{No way. I don't want to hurt the kid's feelings.}
{338}{}{Chipo's at fault! He shouldn't have brought the little beast home. Alvaro didn't have the guts to set things straight either. Shame. A shame there are cowards everywhere.}
{339}{}{Goodbye, sheriff.}
{340}{}{It won't take long. Count the caps, pal.}
{341}{}{I'm counting on you.}
{342}{}{See you, sheriff.}
{343}{}{That pig rat is no longer breathing.}
{344}{}{Chipo must be really upset. Too bad for the kid, but it's his own fault. This'll teach him a valuable lesson.}
{345}{}{If you say so.}
{346}{}{Make sure he learns the right lesson.}
{347}{}{You've got a good grip on things. You might come in handy again. So here's 30 caps, as promised.}
{348}{}{Until next time, sheriff.}

{350}{}{Listen, I really need to know if Tin-Tan has been here.}
{351}{}{Tin-Tan? Sounds like a nickname. Does he have a real name?}
{352}{}{German Henaro Cipriano Gomez Valdes-y-Castillo. He was traveling by caravan from Phoenix to the El Faro fishing village.}
{353}{}{Let me check the migration records... Hold on... Nope, I don't have any records of him visiting Casa Nueva.}
{354}{}{What about the "Sonora Express" stagecoach?}
{355}{}{Just a moment... Yes, I see that name, but... It says the whole caravan was killed by highwaymen before reaching us.}
{356}{}{Well, no luck. Thanks, chief.}

{360}{}{Greetings, brother! Good to see that armor again. But... where are the identification marks? Wait a minute... Who are you? Show your face!}
{361}{}{Brother? You said "brother"? Who are you talking about?}
{362}{}{Damn it, so you're not one of us? How the hell did you get that Power Armor? }
{363}{}{It's my honest trophy. But don't dodge the question. What do you mean by "one of us"?}
{364}{}{(considers his response) Look, if you're not a threat to anyone, why don't you take off the armor and show your real face? This is a peaceful town. No one will attack you unless you're a threat. Show some sense - and then I'll answer your questions. Deal?}
{365}{}{And what makes you think I'm not a threat to anyone? I'm here for exactly that, you idiot!}
{366}{}{Alright, I'll heed your advice.}
{367}{}{You said "brother"? So, you're with the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{368}{}{Boo-boo!}
{369}{}{Bubba-bubba!}
{370}{}{Whoa!}
