{100}{}{You see Don Reavis.}
{101}{}{You see a man with a beautiful black beard and noble bearing.}

{200}{}{Thank you for aiding me against those rebels, friend. Someday they will face the severe retribution they deserve.}
{1200}{}{Thank you for aiding me against those rebels, m'lady. Someday they will face the severe retribution they deserve.}
{201}{}{Who are you exactly?}
{202}{}{I help those in need. But who are you, and how did you upset these peasants?}
{203}{}{I am Don James Reavis, rightful heir and Baron of all Arizona. This state, barbarously stolen from my ancestors, will be reclaimed by its true noble lineage.}
{204}{}{Are you serious?}
{205}{}{And how do you plan to prove that?}
{206}{}{I have documents and an old tombstone bearing my ancestors' names, but will that sway anyone? I'm beyond proving myself to the ignorant. I will simply restore my lands to their rightful heir. I am the Baron of Arizona, and that title should suffice.}
{207}{}{You truly believe you can convince the free people to join your cause?}
{208}{}{Indeed, as you see, many already have. Those who oppose will meet a disgraceful end. Join me, and take the oath. I shall remember your loyalty for all time.}
{209}{}{Sorry, Baron, but my loyalties lie with my own home.}
{210}{}{For your assistance, I acknowledge the sovereignty of your house. Go in peace, friend.}
{211}{}{Goodbye.}
{212}{}{You're just a fraud. I regret breaking up that fight.}
{213}{}{Harsh words for someone who owes one their life. Perhaps we are not aligned. But if our paths cross again, I trust you will exercise discretion.}
{214}{}{It would have been better if the peasants had lynched you. Goodbye.}
{215}{}{I'll finish what the peasants couldn't. Die, scoundrel!}
{216}{}{I will take the oath, O Don Reavis, Baron of Fair Arizona.}
{217}{}{Do you think I believe you? Idiot. I'd rather kill you than side with you!}
