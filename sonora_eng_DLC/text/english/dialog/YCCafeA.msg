{100}{}{You see Edward.}
{101}{}{You see the owner of the local drinking establishment. He's wearing a once-white apron and a cap.}
{102}{}{Not interested.}

{200}{}{Hello... Oh, a human!}
{201}{}{Yup. Is that unusual?}
{202}{}{Uh, looks like I'm in the wrong place. See you...}
{203}{}{Don't get me wrong, but... Don't you know this is a ghoul town? We even raise prices for normies to keep them from sticking around.}
{204}{}{I know. Don't worry, I won't disturb you guys.}
{205}{}{Just bring me a drink already.}
{206}{}{Alright then.}
{207}{}{Good. What's your name?}
{208}{}{Edward, sir.}
{1208}{}{Edward, ma'am.}
{209}{}{Alright, Edward. Show me what you have for lunch.}
{210}{}{Here's the menu, and these are the takeaway items.}
{211}{}{Thanks.}
{212}{}{What would you like, friend?}
{1212}{}{What would you like, my friend?}
{213}{}{What do you want, smoothskin?}
{214}{}{That's it I guess.}
{215}{}{Let's see the menu.}
{216}{}{Come on in, don't be shy. Everyone here is like family! We don't tolerate normies here - double the prices for them. But mutants are always welcome.}
{217}{}{Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm }
{218}{}{. And what's your name?}
{219}{}{I haven't agreed to let you into our club yet. Who are you, anyway?}
{1219}{}{I haven't agreed to let you into our club yet. Who are you, anyway?}

{220}{}{Wanna chat, Ed?}
{221}{}{About what, for instance?}
{222}{}{Enough chat. I've got things to do.}
{223}{}{Is this menu pre-war?}
{224}{}{Spot on. The stuff that comes from the northern caravans mostly stays in the Old Town. We get just the scraps. So I often cook from pre-war supplies. But for us ghouls, it's even better. Ah, nostalgia! The only thing missing for a full taste experience is some good old coffee. What's a cafe without coffee?}
{225}{}{That's damn unfair, Ed. I could poke around these ruins, maybe find some coffee for you?}
{226}{}{Enough of sob stories. I'm here for a snack, not for a nostalgic trip down memory lane.}
{227}{}{Would you risk it for a can of coffee? Then I'll pay you triple for each one!}
{228}{}{Deal. I'll bring you any coffee I find.}
{229}{}{Well, I didn't plan on scavenging in the ruins. But I'll make a note of it in my Pip-Boy.}
{230}{}{You're in luck. I happen to have a full can right here.}
{231}{}{I've got a can of coffee for your cafe.}
{232}{}{(Opens, sniffs, tastes) What a rich flavor! I'll make a good profit with this on the menu. Here's your pay - }
{233}{}{ hubbucks. Bring more if you find any.}
{234}{}{Hubbucks... Hmph. Sure thing.}
{235}{}{Smoothskin, you've got the wrong place. We don't serve your kind here.}
{1235}{}{Smoothskin, you've got the wrong place. We don't serve your kind here.}
{236}{}{Place your order and then get out.}
{237}{}{Well, excuse me... Maybe we could make a deal? I'll pay triple for each bottle.}

{240}{}{Thanks for the electricity, }
{241}{}{! That must have been a dangerous job? Here, take some anti-radiation meds. I think it's the best I can offer to thank you.}
{242}{}{Thanks, Ed. I'll definitely need this.}
{243}{}{That's it? Well, I'll take what I can get.}
{244}{}{Ah, and you can also expect a discount. I charge normies different prices.}
{245}{}{I was just thinking of ordering something. Show me the menu.}
{246}{}{That's great. But right now I need information more than food.}
{247}{}{Thanks for the electricity, }
{248}{}{! That must have been a dangerous task? Here, take some drinks and a meal on the house. And next time, I'll give you a discount.}
{249}{}{}
{250}{}{Senor Gustavo said to come to you for supplies.}
{251}{}{I'll give you some RadAway, Rad-X, antidote, and a stimpak. But only mousetraps have free cheese. You're gonna pay a high price crossing the ruins of San Diego. I hope you make it. Good luck, my friend.}
{1251}{}{I'll give you some RadAway, Rad-X, antidote, and a stimpak. But only mousetraps have free cheese. You're gonna a high price crossing the ruins of San Diego. I hope you make it. Good luck, my friend.}
{252}{}{I need more. Can you show me what you have for sale?}
{253}{}{Thanks, Ed. See you around.}

{260}{}{I need to exchange some old money for caps.}
{261}{}{I'll buy those for }
{262}{}{ caps. Deal?}
{263}{}{Too cheap. Sorry to bother you.}
{264}{}{No need. Better give me something edible.}
{265}{}{[Exchange 1 dollar]}
{266}{}{[Exchange 2 dollars]}
{267}{}{[Exchange 3 dollars]}
{268}{}{[Exchange 4 dollars]}
{269}{}{[Exchange 5 dollars]}
{270}{}{[Exchange 10 dollars]}
{271}{}{[Exchange ALL dollars]}
{272}{}{What, got a hole in your pocket? Happens.}
{273}{}{Yeah, it does...}
{274}{}{Here you go.}
{275}{}{Thanks.}
{276}{}{[Exchange money for caps.]}
{277}{}{[Refuse and leave.]}

{280}{}{Got any work for me?}
{281}{}{Nothing serious really. But... I could use a hand taking some supplies to the workers at the dam.}
{282}{}{No thanks. I don't want to deal with small jobs like that.}
{283}{}{Alright. What kind of supplies?}
{284}{}{Here are five TV dinners for five people. Give one to each of them. You need to get there within today. You'll definitely be faster than the ghouls I usually use. And don't eat any of it on the way. The ghouls at the dam would be VERY unhappy.}
{285}{}{Okay.}
{286}{}{All the ghouls at the dam got their TV dinners.}
{287}{}{Thank you so much. Here's your payment.}
{288}{}{Thanks. See you.}
{289}{}{Thank you so much. Here's your payment. Oh, and by the way, I have some leftovers. Take 'em, it's on the house.}
{290}{}{Thanks.}
{291}{}{Nice, I always enjoy free stuff. See you, Ed.}

{292}{}{Do you know who owns the film "Deep Throat" around here?}
{293}{}{Yes. That would be Raymond. But he'll never part with his favorite film. Though I think he values just the box and has never actually watched it. And don't take the disc from him, he'll go crazy and raise hell around the whole town.}
{294}{}{Thanks for the warning.}

{295}{}{Hey, Ed, I found a food processor with your name on the delivery sheet in the ruins.}
{296}{}{Finally it's found! A delivery bot was supposed to bring it, but something happened. You know, that processor is priceless! We're starving here without proper food. It's gonna greatly improve our situation. So, you say you have it?}
{297}{}{No, uh, I left it where I found it. Sorry.}
{298}{}{That's a shame. We really need that processor! Could you go back and get it? I'll give you 200 caps.}
{299}{}{Well, if I'm in the area.}
{300}{}{Alright.}
{301}{}{Yes, here it is, take it.}
{302}{}{Oh man, you're saving us! Hey, guys, look, this smoothskin really helped us out. Thank him!}
{303}{}{Glad to help. Goodbye, Ed.}
{304}{}{Damn, De Santi would've given me more... Oh, I was talking about something else, never mind. Uh, see you.}
{305}{}{Oh man, you're saving us, my friend! Hey, guys, thank him!}
