{100}{}{You see Christopher.}
{101}{}{You see a young soldier, his expression both sad and contemplative.}
{102}{}{Watch out for the super mutants, buddy.}

{200}{}{Hello... uh... Didn't know there were civilians... uh... Welcome aboard.}
{201}{}{You seem a little distracted.}
{202}{}{Why are you mumbling? That's not very military-like.}

{210}{}{Ahem... I... I've been thinking a lot about home lately. Junior Paladin Christopher, uh... How can I help you?}
{211}{}{Sorry to bother you. I'm leaving.}
{212}{}{Junior Paladin Christopher... at your service. What do you need?}

{220}{}{You were talking about home. Is it far from here?}
{221}{}{Lost Hills Bunker... it's, uh... it's all the way back in California. I was born there, raised there... A long way northwest of here. Convoys... they take about a month to get that far... or longer. It... it feels like a lifetime ago.}
{222}{}{Tell me about life in the bunker.}
{223}{}{A bunker, you say? Man was born to live under the sun, not in dark basements.}
{224}{}{I... I miss those dark halls... the sound of the wires overhead... everything we needed was right there. Food, energy... even distractions. But here... out here... we're free, right? Free, but... living like animals. It's not the same. It... it never will be.}
{225}{}{You don't like Arizona?}
{226}{}{A soldier shouldn't really whine about tough conditions.}
{227}{}{The desert... it's just miles and miles of suffocating sand. I've seen sand in California... but those sands... they felt familiar, they were ours. Here... everything feels wrong... foreign. Most of the Brotherhood... they feel the same.}
{228}{}{You just haven't seen all the local beauty.}
{229}{}{So you finally crawled out of your dark dungeon?}
{230}{}{I... I was barely initiated when they called me into the attack troop. Got my title and... suddenly we were thrown into battle. The Master's army... they just started rolling over settlements. One minute, I was in the safety of the bunker... the next... hell.}
{231}{}{Was it hard in battle?}
{232}{}{What, are your nerves too weak for service?}
{233}{}{If... if it weren't for the training... I wouldn't have made it. The hardest part wasn't the fighting... it was... losing my brothers. I... I still have this photo. It's our squad, right before we hit Necropolis... Seven of us. Only two made it out... me and the commander.}
{234}{}{Continue.}
{235}{}{You're just gonna spill your whole story, aren't you...}
{236}{}{I... I pulled him out. Dragged him from the crossfire. Super mutants were everywhere... We barely made it to the sewers before... they hit the hatch with a rocket. The whole exit collapsed behind us.}
{237}{}{Sounds tough.}
{238}{}{You're lucky.}
{239}{}{Lucky... yeah... I guess so. But... the other squads were still out there... fighting, dying. And me... I... I don't even know why I'm telling you this... You wouldn't understand... you're not one of us. So... I should go. Good luck... out there... in the desert, or... whatever.}
{240}{}{Thanks for the story. Sometimes it's worth speaking out, even if it's to a stranger. Good luck, paladin.}
{241}{}{Yeah, I don't understand how someone like you survives. I hope you get sent back to that dark bunker.}
