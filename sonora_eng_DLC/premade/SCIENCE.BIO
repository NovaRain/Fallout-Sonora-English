
BIO:

Silent, quiet,
and quite unobtrusive,
a resident of the Villa.
What is on his mind
has always been hard
to understand, even
for those close to him.
His unsociability became
the subject of ridicule
and dislike, but Ramon
skillfully turned his
character traits to his
advantage and to the
benefit of the Villa
when he took up scouting
and foraging.
If anyone can survive
far from home,
itâ€™s him.
